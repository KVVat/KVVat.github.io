</head>
<body>
<h1>JavaScript Front-end Development: Errors, Events, Objects, &amp; New Features</h1>
<p>JavaScript has rich language features to help you deal with errors 
and events. This course explores the basics of events and error handling
 and also covers working with strings, numbers, dates and some new 
ECMAScript language features. You'll start by exploring techniques for 
JavaScript front end development. Next, you will discover events and 
event handlers, and perform error handling. Other topics of this course 
include the following: how to consider the fundamentals of strings; 
perform common string operations; create and use regular expressions; 
format numbers, and perform common operations, with the Number object; 
how to perform common calculations with the Math object; how to use the 
Date object; how to explore how to use the LET and CONST keywords, 
instead of VAR, when a variable is declared. As you progress, you will 
discover JavaScript's KeyedCollection, and use the Map and Set objects. 
Conclude by learning how to use hoisting, string padding, Async 
Functions, and Promises.</p>

JavaScript Events and Event Handlers
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: JavaScript Events and Event Handlers. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at events and event
 handlers in JavaScript. On the screen we have Notepad++ opened up, and 
it is pointing to an HTML file. And within that file, on line 4, we are 
pointing to a JavaScript file. That file is empty at the moment, but we 
will fill it in. It's an external file, and we will fill that in 
shortly. On the right side of the screen is a Chrome browser that is 
rendering the page you see on the left, the HTML page on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In browser, the following text 
appears This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph. It also has a 
Button labeled as, button On-Click event:</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this demonstration is about events, and events happen all the 
time. What we're looking at on the right hand side is a browser window 
that is open. And the moment this browser window was opened, that in 
itself was an event. Every time I move my mouse over this browser page 
it is an event, or there are several events that are happening. When we 
close the browser, that's another event. And when I move my mouse over 
different parts of the page, these can also trigger events. But one of 
the most common event, of course, is the button click event. So we have 
on this page a button, and if I were to click on it then, actually there
 are several events that are happening.</p>
<p>There's a button press, there's a button release, there's a 
mouseover, a hover over. These are all events that are happening just on
 that one button, on that button itself or the surface of the button 
itself. But today we will focus on the button click event. So JavaScript
 was meant to work with these events, to handle these events as they 
occur. Events are basically triggers. Now, on the left side of your 
screen there's an HTML document. And as I mentioned, it is supposed to 
be pointing to a scripts.js file. So let's go ahead and complete that. 
So on line 4 we have a script tag and a source, attribute of that script
 tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket, script, S r c, =, double quote, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And within those double quotation marks is where we are going to 
identify the JavaScript file that this HTML document is going to work 
with.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 4, between double quote, he declares scripts dot j s.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Once we've done that, then we need to start what's called wiring up 
our button event. So on lines, let's see, lines 15 and 16, that's our 
button tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: open angular 
bracket, button, close angular bracket. The code on line 16 is: Button 
on-click event, open angular bracket, slash, button, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And within the button tag, one of the attributes is that we can now 
tap into or get into the trigger of this button. So on line 15 where it 
says button, I'm going to change that tag to include the On-click 
events, or to capture the On-click event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 15, the new code is, open angle bracket, button, on click, close angle bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, once I capture the On-click event, I have to point it to 
JavaScript function. So let's finish the On-click event. So whenever 
that On-click happens it's going to be pointing to a function. And that 
function is going to be called message.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 15, after on-click, he 
declares, =, double quote, message, open close curved brackets, double 
quote. the new code is, open angle bracket, button, on click, =, double 
quote, message, open close curved brackets, double quote, close angle 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I haven't written the function as yet. But at least now my 
button is going to be pointing to a message function. Let's move over to
 the JavaScript file where I am now going to write that function. So I 
definitely need the word function. And from that point on I would name 
that function message. I have my curly braces, and within those curly 
braces is where I am going to define what this function is going to do.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 1, he writes function, 
message, open close curved bracket, open curly bracket. On code line 2, 
the following code is present: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically, all I really want to do is issue some kind of an alert.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 2. The code is: alert, open close curved brackets, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the user clicks on that button. And they get a message popping up 
on the browser screen. And all I really wanted to display is a simple 
message. You have just witnessed an event in JS!</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 2, between open close 
curved brackets, the following text appears: open quote, You have just 
witnessed an event in J S, exclamation mark, close quote., The new code 
is, alert, open curved bracket, open quote, You have just witnessed an 
event in J S, exclamation mark, close quote, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the good thing about Notepad++ is that, if you notice, I've made
 changes on both documents. So this icon which, one, two, three, the 
fourth icon to the right is a Save All icon. If I click on that, then I 
will save all of the files that had changes to them. Now, once those 
changes have been saved I can move over to my browser screen, refresh 
the browser screen. And now when I click on that button I see the event 
happening.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Button on-click event, a
 message box with the following text appears on the screen: This page 
says, You have just witnessed an event in J S.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll click OK on the message box to make it go away. And back on the 
Notepad++, you can now go ahead and wire up several other events. So, 
for example, there's the hover event. There is the mouseover event. 
There is the timer event if you wanted to have something happen after a 
certain amount of time has passed. So there are a lot of events in 
JavaScript, and a lot of events that the HTML document can trigger.</p></div>

JavaScript Error Handling
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: JavaScript Error Handling. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we are going to take a look at error handling 
with JavaScript. I have Notepad++ opened and there are two files in 
Notepad++. An HTML document and that HTML document is pointing to an 
external JavaScript file on line 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket, script, s r c, =, double quote, scripts.js, double quote, close
 angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's the second document that is opened in Notepad++, as you can see,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the second document open in notepad ++. it is titled scripts.js</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>there is the external JavaScript file with one function on it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code on line 1. The 
code here is: function, demo, open curve bracket, x, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to switch back over now to HTML file. On the right side of 
your screen is a Chrome browser that is opened up and displaying or 
rendering the file, the HTML file that you see on the left. Now in 
Chrome, I also have the developer tools opened because we are working 
with errors and I wanted to make sure that there are no syntax errors 
once we start working with our JavaScript in this case. So let's take a 
look at line 15, that's our button tag and it is pointing to a demo 
function when the onclick event occurs.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: open angular 
bracket, button on click, =, double quote, demo, open curve bracket, 2, 
close curve bracket, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it's also passing a parameter, an argument of 2 to the demo 
function. So that demo function will of course be defined in the 
scripts.js file. And there you see it, right there. It is expecting a 
parameter to be passed, and the rest of the function is defined between 
lines 2 and 6.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the script.js file, the presenter 
points to x, in the code on line 1. He then shifts to the codes present 
between lines 2 and 6. The code on line 2 is: double quote, use strict, 
double quote, semi colon. The code on line 3 is: var, answer =0, semi 
colon. The code on line 4 is: let scores =, open square bracket, 4, 
comma 9, comma, 6, comma, 5, comma, 7, close square bracket, semi colon.
 The code on line 5 is: answer = scores, open square bracket, x, close 
square bracket, semi colon. The code on line 6 is: document dot get 
element by ID, open curve bracket, double quote, p2, double quote, close
 curve bracket, dot, inner HTML, = answer, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We will be changing this function as we move on. So this function is 
only for demonstration, nothing here really makes much sense. But it is 
expecting a parameter, and in this case, I believe we're passing a 2, so
 2 will be passed into demo.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the first document and highlights 2, in the code on line 15. He then goes back to the script.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That 2 will then be used within the scores array to pick out</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights scores in the code on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the third element, in this case, it's going to be 6.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights x in the code on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That 6 will then be stored in another variable called answer,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights answer in the code on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>which will then be displayed on the p2 tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights p2, in the code on line 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Which is, if we move over to the Chrome document, it's a paragraph 
that says, This is another paragraph. So those words will be replaced by
 answer, whatever that answer happens to be.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights answer in the code on line 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So just to demonstrate, if I click on the button right now, we do see
 a 6 because, remember we passed in 2, so that's our third element.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on a button titled, button on-click event, present in the browser. A result, which is 6, is displayed.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So 0, 1, 2, so the 6 is being grabbed by the scores subscript 6, scores subscript 2 will return the 6 in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 6, in the code on line 
4. He then highlights scores, open square bracket, x, close square 
bracket, in the code on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That 6 would be stored in answer. 6 is now going to be replaced by 
whatever the paragraph tag said before. Let's refresh the browser 
screen. So now it's back to the original and I'll move over to the 
scripts tag. Now, what we want to do is insert the error handling 
method. In this case, it's a try catch block and it works exactly like 
in other languages like C++ or Java, C#, etc. So the idea is that if you
 think something is going to go wrong or could go wrong, then let's wrap
 up that part of our code that we think an error might occur within this
 try catch block. So what I'm going to do is between lines 2 and 3 and 
then between lines 4 and 5, I'm going to make some space myself. So, 
let's make some space now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> An empty space is created in line 4 
and line 7. The code on line 4 has shifted to line 5 and the code on 
line 5 has shifted to line 6. The code on line 6 is now on line 8.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I expect an error to happen between lines 5 and 6, okay? So 
between lines 5 and 6, what I'm going to do is move those over to the 
right and then wrap those up with a try catch block. So that try catch 
block obviously starts on 4 and finishes on 7.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In line 4, he adds a new code: try, open curly bracket. In line 7, he adds the code: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it means then that if ever anything occurs, any error occurs 
between 5 and 6, I can now write a catch block to catch that error. So 
on line 7, I have inserted a catch block. And then what I want to do now
 is make some space again, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a space between line 7 and 9. Line 8 is now empty and the code on line 8 has shifted to line 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>then I can write whatever I want to have happen when that error occurred.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 7. The code is: close curly bracket, catch, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I want to have happen then is I want to make that same answer
 but use the same variable answer but store something different. I'm 
going to store maybe a message to the user that something happened. So 
I'm going to say, answer is equal to, and whatever that message is going
 to be. Remember, this message will only happen when there's an error. 
So what I want to let the user know is that hey, there's invalid data 
that you passed over to this function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 8. The code here is: answer, =, open quote, invalid data, exclamation mark, close quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just those simple changes I can refresh, I can save those 
changes, refresh the browser screen. I could click on button, and so far
 nothing's happening. So let's refresh the screen again, let's make 
something happen, let's invoke an error. Notice that I have on line 2, 
use strict.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's say, what happens if I did not use the let statement or let 
keyword in front of scores. So let's remove let, save the change, 
refresh the browser screen,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes let, from the code on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>notice nothing happens. But if I click on the button click event, it 
says, Invalid data. So the catch block was triggered, in this case, 
because an error occurred between lines 5 and 6. So let's put in that 
word back there, that keyword, let. And now what I want to demonstrate 
is the finally block.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds let, at the beginning of line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So just like in other languages, we do have a finally block, I'm 
going to put that in on line 9, and I'm going to make some space again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new code on line 9 is: close curly bracket, finally, open close curly brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And what I'm going to put inside of the finally block will run, will 
execute no matter what. So as long as I hit that button, whatever I have
 in finally will execute regardless of whether there was an error or 
not.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes the close curly bracket 
from the end of line 9 and shifts it to line 11. An empty space is added
 on line 10. The code on line 10 has shifted to line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Probably want to access the third paragraph, which is underneath the 
button, and I want to issue some other message. So I'm going to say, the
 inner HTML of that paragraph is equal to something, and I can probably,
 again, this is just for demonstration purposes. I'll say that the 
finally always execute.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> New codes are added on line 10 and 
11. The code on lines 11 and 12 have shifted to 12 and 13 respectively. 
The new code on line 10 is: document dot get element by ID, open curve 
bracket, double quote, p3, double quote, close curve bracket, dot, inner
 HTML, =. The code on line 11 is: open quote, finally will always 
execute, exclamation mark, close quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save those changes, refresh the browser screen, click on the 
button click event. Notice that everything works fine just like we did 
before, except that we now have the finally block executing. And it's 
replacing the paragraph 3 with the words that I have on line 11.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser, the text, Finally will always execute, exclamation mark, appears below the button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So finally will always execute.</p></div>

JavaScript String Basics
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: JavaScript String Basics. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to work with JavaScript Strings. On 
the screen, I have Notepad++ opened up, and it is pointing to an HTML 
file. That HTML file is pointing on line 4 to an external JavaScript 
file called Scripts.js.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket, script, s r c, =, double quote, scripts.js, double quote, close
 angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've also got that opened up in Notepad++ on the second tab. On the 
right side of your screen is a Chrome browser rendering the file that 
you see on the left. Now this demonstration is just to show some basic 
ideas and concepts about strings. So the first thing to understand is 
that when we work with a browser we are working with strings. The 
browser does not understand numbers or decimals or objects. It 
understands strings. So anything that is displayed on a browser window 
is, in the end, a string. So I've got a button on the browser. And that 
button is wired up to a demo function that is inside of our external 
file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 14. 
The code here is: open angular bracket, button on click, =, double 
quote, demo, open curve bracket, open quote, a string, period, close 
quote, close curve bracket, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We are passing to that demo function, it's a string called a string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, a string, in the code on line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if we go to that function we see that our demo function is here. 
And it is accepting a string via some kind of a variable called x in 
this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the tab titled, 
scripts.js in notepad++. He goes to the code on line 1. the code here 
is: function, demo, open curve bracket, x, close curve bracket, open 
curly bracket. He highlights x, in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to demonstrate is concatenation. And we see 
that happening in the function definition between lines 2 and 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 2 is: document dot 
get element by ID, open curve bracket, double quote, p2, double quote, 
close curve bracket, dot, inner HTML, =. The code on line 3 is: accent, 
this is $ sign, open curly bracket, x, close curly bracket, accent, semi
 colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I'm doing is I'm taking the string that was passed via the variable x and concatenating it to another string on line 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights x in the code on line 1, and then highlights, This is, in the code on line 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That entire sentence will be sent to the paragraph 2 tag, the 
innerHTML of that tag on the browser screen. And what you're seeing on 
the right side of your screen is that entire string. So you don't see, 
this is, you see, this is a string. Because the a string part was passed
 in via our variable x, or parameter x, in this case. So concatenation 
can happen in strings and by the way I'm using templated strings here. 
But, of course, the traditional concatenation character, that plus 
character, can also be used. The other thing that we need to remember 
about strings in Javascript is that every string is an object. And it 
means then that object would probably have properties and methods or 
both. In the case of our string x, it does have a property called length
 that we can tap into. So if I wanted to print the length, for example, I
 could probably extend the length, well, the sentence on line 3, I can 
expand that sentence to perhaps print our length. So I can say, and the 
length is, and here, I'm going to use the template again. So it's $ and 
two curly braces and now I can use my x and invoke that property of that
 x called length.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 3. The 
new code on line 3 is: accent, this is $ sign, open curly bracket, x, 
close curly bracket, comma, the length is $ sign, open curly bracket, x 
dot length, close curly bracket, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just that change let's save our change to line 3, refresh the
 browser screen, click on the button again, and I must have spelled it 
wrong. L-E-N-G-T-H, so let's spell it correctly and we should now see 
the number 9. Let's refresh the browser screen, click that button again,
 and there is the length is 9.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on browser screen is: This is a string, period, comma, the length is 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But this also means that we can invoke methods of the string object. 
So JavaScript has included a method called bold. And let's just say, I 
wanted to bold just the 9 in this case. Well, there's a couple of things
 I have to do. First of all, I am going to push the 9 part over to the 
next line in my JavaScript file, so that I don't run off the side of the
 page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He breaks the code on line 3. The 
code on line 3 is: accent, this is $ sign, open curly bracket, x, close 
curly bracket, comma, the length is. The code on line 4 is: $ sign, open
 curly bracket, x dot length, close curly bracket, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now once I've done that, I can wrap up my x.length, which is a number
 by the way. So because it's a number, I'm going to have to turn that 
number into a toString before I can invoke the bold method on our 
string. So x.length, I'm going to have to access the toString method. So
 toString, first of all, that'll turn the 9 into a string. Now I can 
call upon or invoke the bold method. So now that I have a string, I can 
invoke the bold method on that string,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 4. The 
new code is: $ sign, open curly bracket, open curve bracket, x dot 
length, close curve bracket, dot, to string, open close curve brackets, 
dot bold, open close curve brackets, close curly bracket, accent, semi 
colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>save my changes, refresh the browser screen, click the button again, 
and now just the 9 only is bolded. So stings act as objects as well. Now
 the last part of this discussion is to work with strings in the console
 window. Now remember, the browser can only understand strings and it 
doesn't understand anything else like numbers or decimals or even 
objects. But if we pass our string, our sentence in this case between 
lines 3 and 4, to the console window. Then what we're doing is we're 
working with a different technology. So let's see what this looks like. 
I'll replace line 2, the entire line 2, with just the console.log. I'll 
wrap everything up in parenthesis.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 2. The 
new code is: console, dot log, open curve bracket. He adds a close curve
 bracket between accent and semi colon, on line 4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'll save those changes, refresh the browser screen. Click the 
button and then down below in the console window, you see the result of 
doing those changes to lines 3 and 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The console on the browser shows the 
result in two lines. The first line is: This is a string, period, comma,
 The length is. The second line is: open angular bracket, b, close 
angular bracket, 9, open angular bracket, slash, b, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What the console window has done is it has treated this string, our 
templated string in this case, as a literal. Meaning that it saw a break
 after the is, the word is, and the console window sought to put the 
next line down onto the next line in the console window. But this is 
great. This could probably work to our advantage. So, for example, if I 
wanted to move the entire, the length is, part of the string, I can 
probably put a \n in front of that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a back slash n, before, the length is, in the code on line 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the browser screen, click the button, and now the length has been pushed over to the next line down.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The console on the browser shows the 
result in 3 lines. The first line is: This is a string, period, semi 
colon, The second line is: The length is. The third line is: open 
angular bracket, b, close angular bracket, 9, open angular bracket, 
slash, b, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we can do this with several of these escape characters in the 
console window, we won't be able to this with the browser. So that's a 
basic look at strings in JavaScript.</p></div>

Common String Methods
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Common String Methods. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to discuss JavaScript string 
methods. On the screen we have an HTML document opened in Notepad++. On 
the right side of the screen is a Chrome browser rendering that document
 on the left. The HTML document on the left has some JavaScript between 
lines 10 and 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 10 is: open angular 
bracket, script, close angular bracket. The code on line 11 is: let, p 
1, =, document dot get Element By I D, open curved bracket, double 
quote, p1, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon, The code on 
line 12 is: let, s s, =, open quote, Percipio by Skillsoft, close quote,
 semi-colon. The code on line 13 is: p1, dot inner Html, =, s s, 
semi-colon. The code on line 14 is: open angular bracket, slash, script,
 close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML document has a p1 tag on line 8, and the JavaScript between</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 8 is: open angular 
bracket, p, i d, =, double quote, p 1, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>lines 10 and 14 is using that p1 tag to pass a sentence to it. So on 
line 12, there's a variable called ss, and to that variable is assigned a
 sentence. That sentence is then being passed to the p1.innerHTML, and 
that's what is showing on the browser on the right side of your screen. 
So this is about string methods and one of the more popular methods is 
the toUpperCase method. So I can take my ss variable, which is in effect
 a sort of like a string object, I can take that object and apply the 
toUpperCase method to it. So I can do something like, on line 13, I can 
add the toUpperCase</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. The code
 is: p 1, dot inner html, =, s s, semi-colon. After S S, he writes dot 
to Uppercase, open close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>method to that string object, save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and now the entire sentence is now uppercase.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: 
JavaScript String Methods. The following text in Uppercase appears on 
the screen: Percipio By SkillSoft.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now that may be what was required. But in my case, I really only want
 to target the first word, Percipio in this case. And I want to turn 
that into uppercase, but leave everything else the way it is. So 
JavaScript, like in most other languages, does have a substring method. 
And I can apply that substring method before I apply the toUpperCase 
method. So again, on line 13, I am going to change that statement there.
 I'm going to change ss, instead of ss.toUpperCase, I'm going to insert 
before the toUpperCase on line 13, I'm going to insert the substring 
method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. after s s, he writes dot Substring, open close curved bracket</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now as in most other languages, you have to tell substring exactly 
where you want to start and where you want to end. And substring will 
remove just that part of the sentence for you, and then you can apply 
the toUpperCase afterwards. So I need to tell it to start at point 0, 
which is the P, and go for 8 characters, because Percipio is eight 
letters long.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. After substring, he writes 0, comma 8 between the open-close curved brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now I have isolated Percipio and I've turned it into an uppercase 
word. So let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and 
there's my Percipio all in uppercase.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: 
JavaScript String Methods. The following text in Uppercase appears on 
the screen: Percipio.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The thing is, I have to find now a way to sort of join back the rest 
of the sentence to what I have on the screen. So because I'm going to be
 running off the side of the Notepad++ document, I'm going to move over 
to line 14 with the next statement. So what I want to do is somehow 
concatenate back the rest of the sentence. So let's see, on line 13 I'm 
going to add the concatenation character and then on line 14 I'm going 
to use that same substring again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On line 14, he declares a code. The code is: s s dot substring, open close curved brackets, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But this time, I'm going to start in the sort of like the middle, 
just after the Percipio word. I'll start there, so that's position 8. 
Now, I need to go to the rest of the sentence because I need the entire 
sentence. Now if you remember, we do have a property of string objects 
called a length, so I could use that to my advantage here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 14, between the open close curved bracket, he writes, 0, comma, s s dot length.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, basically, what I'm saying is that let's take Percipio in 
uppercase, but concatenate it back with the rest of the string but 
starting at position 8 and going until the string ends. Let's save these
 changes, refresh the browser screen, and notice that everything is back
 together again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: 
JavaScript String Methods. Percipio By Skillsoft. In the last sentence, 
Percipio is in the uppercase.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But whenever Skillsoft talks about Percipio, it talks about Percipio 
as being powered by Skillsoft. So I want to use the same sentence but 
insert the word powered before the word by in this case. So it means, 
then, that I have to target that space between O and b, and somehow 
insert a new word into that space. If we look at what's on the browser 
screen right now, we can think of that entire structure as an object. 
And it means, then, that I can probably sort of isolate that object by 
wrapping it up in parentheses. So I started on line 13 by wrapping up 
the first part of that statement</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. Before s s, he inserts open curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>in parentheses, and ending on line 14 with another closing 
parentheses. Now I can issue to that entire structure the replace 
method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 14. After length, close curved bracket, he writes dot replace, open close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, what do I want to replace? Well, I want to replace that space. So
 I have to let the replace method know that I want to replace something,
 and what do I want to replace? Well, I can use the Spacebar between the
 two apostrophes and tell it that I'm looking for a space. Now what 
replace is going to do is to look for the very first occurrence of that 
space character, and that's going to work to our advantage. So, what do I
 want to replace it with? Well, I want to replace it with something. And
 that something is the word powered. Now, obviously, in order to make 
this more readable, I'm going to have to insert a space before the p in 
the word powered and after d in the word powered.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 14. He 
writes, open quote, space close quote, comma, open quote, space powered,
 space close quote,in between the open curved bracket after replace.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just this simple change, I can save the changes, refresh the browser screen, and there you see my powered by.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: 
JavaScript String Methods. Percipio powered by Skillsoft. In the last 
sentence, Percipio is in the uppercase.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So these are just a few string methods in JavaScript, there are a lot
 more. But at least I've shown you some of the more common ones here.</p></div>

<h2 id="d5346be0-7b76-11e8-b52b-2d384025e4de">
Regular Expressions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Regular Expressions. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to discuss regular expressions in 
JavaScript. On the left side of your screen, I have an HTML document 
opened up, and there's some JavaScript between lines 9 and 17. On the 
right side of your screen, there is a Chrome browser showing you how the
 HTML file on the left is going to be rendered. If you're familiar with 
searching in a text editor or a word processor like Microsoft Word, then
 regular expressions work behind the scenes for those searches. Also, if
 you've ever used database searches and used wildcards, then regular 
expressions are very similar. But the power of regular expressions 
really come in handy when we have users inputting data or inputting 
values into text boxes.</p>
<p>So regular expressions are used to verify certain common patterns 
like phone numbers, postal codes, emails, etc. So basically regular 
expressions are used to match one pattern against some body of text. 
Now, regular expressions is a vast topic on its own. And this 
demonstration is not about regular expressions, it's about how 
JavaScript implements regular expressions. And how you, as a developer, 
can use regular expressions with JavaScript. In JavaScript, there are 
basically two ways to implement regular expressions, as a literal or by 
creating a regular expression object. We'll explore both situations in 
this demonstration. In my first example, on line 10, I've created or 
declared a variable called ss, and have assigned to that variable a 
sentence.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 10 is: let ss, =, open quote, percipio by skillsoft, close quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 11, I've declared another variable and I'm using ss as though
 it is an object. And I'm using the search method of that object to find
 the expression y.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: let found, =, ss dot search, open curve bracket, slash, y, slash, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, basically I'm using a string method and passing it a regular 
expression. And that string method will return to me a -1 if it does not
 find the expression within the sentence, or the yes string object in 
this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 12. The
 code here is: if, open curve bracket, found, exclamation mark, =, minus
 1, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Other than that, it will return to me some type of positive number or
 zero if the search item happens to be in the first character in that 
sentence. So in this first example, we're searching for a y in this 
sentence Percipio by Skillsoft and it does find it. And I'm using an if 
statement to figure out whether I get a -1 or not. What's interesting 
though, is that it not only returns the fact that it's a positive 
number, this search method will also return what position our y happens 
to be in. So, if i wanted to find that out. In this case, I know, this 
is just for demonstration purposes, I know that there is a y. So on my 
line 13, I could expand that a little bit to concatenate whatever Found 
happens to be, whatever value that is.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: p1, dot inner
 HTML, =, open quote, found, colon, close curve bracket, close quote, +,
 found, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I save these changes, refresh the browser screen, I do see that it happens to be at position 10 in that sentence.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result shown on the browser screen is: Found, colon, close curve bracket, 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, there happens to be another string method called match. And 
match is very interesting because match returns the array when it finds 
the item. So for that I'm going to restructure my code a little bit. I'm
 going to keep my line 11, but I'm going to replace search with match.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 11. Now, the code here is: let found, =, ss dot match, open curve 
bracket, slash, y, slash, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And instead of having an if structure, I'm simply going to use the 
innerHTML of my p1 tag declared on line 8, to display the various method
 elements of match.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes the code on line 12. The 
following lines shift one place up. So, the code on line 13 is now on 
line 12, and so on. He then removes the codes from line 13 to 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's remove line 12 and I'll remove just about everything else in
 the stiff structure. And I'm only going to use the innerHTML, and I'm 
going to pass to that innerHTML, in this case it's going to be an array,
 so my found array. And I'm going to grab the first element of that 
array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. Now,
 the code here is: p1, dot inner HTML, =, found, open square bracket, 0,
 close square bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this change. So remember, line 12 has now been changed to 
just an innerHTML of my p1 tag. And I'm accessing the very first element
 of that found array because match method will return an array to me. 
Okay, so let's save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and what I
 get back is the y itself. So that's telling me that my string, in this 
case, was found. Let's see what will happen if I don't find the string. 
So I know y together, it does not exist.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 11, the presenter adds one more y, next to the already present y.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh the browser screen, notice nothing 
happens. But it's not just that nothing happens. Let's hit F12 on the 
keyboard to get into the developer tools. And what you'll see is that 
what match actually returned was a null object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the console on the browser, 
following text appears: Uncaught type error, colon, cannot read 
property, open quote 0, close quote, of null, at 1 3 9 7 1 4.html colon 
12. The presenter highlights null in the statement.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to hit F12 again to get rid of the developer tools, and 
let's head back over to line 12. Another interesting feature of match is
 that if we attempt to access the index of our search term, now let's 
make our search term. I'm changing line 11 again back to the original y 
that I had, and I changed line 12 to access the index of my found array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. Now,
 the code here is: p1, dot inner HTML, =, found, dot index, semi colon. 
He removes, one instance of y, from the code on line11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this change, refresh our browser screen. Notice that I get
 10. Remember, that was the number that we got before. So what 
found.index is showing me is that my y is actually at position 9 in that
 ss string object. Something else that's interesting with our match 
method is how it finds the search term that we're looking for. And let's
 search for an s in this case, and let's see s exists.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, y, with s, in code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to change my found again to, well, actually, let's use 
another property of that array, lets use the length array. I'm going to 
use the length array. Because, by the way, match will return, depending 
on how we structure our code for line 11, it will tell me exactly how 
many occurrences of that search term it finds.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 12, he replaces index, with length.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this case here, it should find at least one s. Let's save that 
change, refresh the browser screen. Notice that I get a 1. So that 1 
tells me that there is at least one s in my sentence. But what if there 
was more than one? In this case, we have two different s's.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the word skillsoft, present in the code on line 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In that case, I can apply a flag. In this case, the i flag will 
indicate to the match object that I'm looking for either upper case or 
lowercase s in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 11, he adds, i, 
between the slash and close curve bracket. Now, the code on line 11 is 
let found, =, ss dot match, open curve bracket, slash, s, slash, i, 
close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, let's see if it brings back the two s's that's in Skillsoft. 
Let's save our changes, refresh the screen, notice nothing happens. 
Well, we've still got our 1. In this case, it is finding the first 
uppercase s but it's ignoring the second lowercase s.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the first instance of s
 in skillsoft, which is in upper case, and then highlights the second 
instance of s in skillsoft, which is in lower case.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We can actually apply another flag called the g flag, and g will now return all the occurrences of s's.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, g, after i, in the code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this, refresh our browser screen, notice that it has 
changed to 2. For my next example, I'm actually going to be using a 
regular expression as an object. So I'm going to change line 11 to be 
something like searchTerm. And I'm going to assign to that searchTerm a 
regular expression. Now, let's just look for the word itself, by, in 
this case. So the moment I structure my line 11 like this, searchTerm 
now becomes a regular expression object. For next thing I'm going to</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 11. The new code is: let, search term, =, slash, by, slash, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>do or, by the way, the search method that I'm going to be using right
 now, actually returns a Boolean value, true or false. So let's declare 
another variable, let's call it found, to be equal to whatever my search
 term. Well, I'm going to use searchTerm as an object. And I'm going to 
access or invoke the test method of that object. And I'm going to pass 
to that object the sentence that I had originally, so ss in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds a new line of code
 on line 12. The current code on line 12, shifts to line 13. The new 
code on line 12 is: let, found, =, search term, dot test, open curve 
bracket, ss, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, like I said, what the test method will return is actually true or false.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes dot length, from the code on line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen and notice that it found by in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on the browser screen shows true.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the regular expression object does have another method called exec, which will do something a little bit different.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces test, with exec, in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I used exec instead of test on line 12 and I pass it the same 
sentence, let's refresh the browser screen. Notice that it returned the 
actual word itself. So you can use this in an FL structure.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on the browser screen shows, by.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the final thing that I wanted to show you is how to use the 
regular expression constructor. S, what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
actually use my same searchTerm but invoke the regular expression 
constructor in this way. And in the constructor, I'm going to pass the 
searchTerm. But notice that I can now pass the searchTerm just like a 
regular string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 11. The 
new code is: let, search term, =, new, Reg, E x p, open curve bracket, 
open quote, by, close quote, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it means that I now can pass strings into this searchTerm regular 
expression object. And that's the only change I need to make. Let's save
 the changes, refresh your browser screen, notice that it returned the 
very same thing. It's returned by, in this case. So that's a short 
introduction to regular expressions in JavaScript.</p></div>

Number Object
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Number Object. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to be working with JavaScript 
numbers. I have two applications open, on the left is a Notepad++ 
application opened up to an HTML file, which is a mixture of JavaScript 
and HTML. On the right side of your screen is a Chrome browser rendering
 the file that you see on the left. The HTML file on your left has a 
paragraph tag declared on line 8. We'll be using that paragraph tag to 
display some of the features of the number object in JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 8 is: open angular 
bracket, p, i d, =, double quote, p 1, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>JavaScript really only have one number type, and that's a 64-bit 
floating point number. So it means, then, that whatever we need do in 
terms of numbers, we only really have just one data type to work with. 
So negative numbers, decimal numbers, in fact, on line 11, there's a 
binary number declared there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: let, num 1, =, 0 b 1 0 1, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 12, this is an example of representing an exponential number in JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: let, num 2, =, 47 e 2, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So bottom line is that JavaScript just has one number type and that's
 it, that's all we have to work with. So if you ever wanted to see what a
 binary number would look like, on line 17 I can start working with 
these various variables to see what they would produce. So let's turn 
this into a templated string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17. the code
 is: p 1, dot inner html, =, accent, accent, semi-colon, he modifies the
 code, the new code is, p 1, dot inner html, =, accent, dollar sign, 
open curved bracket, num 1, close curved bracket, accent, semi-colon,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I will display the binary number 101, now of course, 101 in 
binary is a number 5. So let's save that change to line 17, refresh the 
browser page, and there's your 5.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 12, there is an example of an exponential number. And I kept 
it short just to make a point here. And, basically, what this means is, 
take the number before the e, multiply that number by 10 to the power of
 whatever number appears after the e. So, basically, this is 47 times 10
 to the power of 2. So let's see what that looks like, I'm going to 
change line 17 from num1 to num2. And let's save that change, refresh 
the browser screen, and there you see it is basically 47 multiplied by 
100, which gives us 4700.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 4700.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, what is interesting about JavaScript numbers is when we start 
working with them and sort of combining strings and numbers together. If
 you look at line 13, we're declaring a number, well, we're declaring a 
string in this case but that string happens to be a number.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: let num 3, =, open quote, 3, close quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And let's say if I wanted to, let's say, add the num3 variable to the
 num4 variable, so 3 plus 4, let's see what will produce. So num3 + 
num4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 17, he writes num 3 + num 4, in place of num 2, after the dollar sign inside the curly brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh the browser screen, and we get 34.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 34..</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The idea here is that the plus character is behaving as a 
concatenation operator. Now, the funny thing is that if we were to use 
one of the other arithmetic operators, like multiply in this case,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17, he replaces + with the multiply sign.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it will actually work in terms of numeric data.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 12..</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I refresh the screen, we see 4 multiplied by 3 will give us 12.
 So it's important to understand that, that plus character can give you 
the wrong result, depending on what you're trying to do. Now, number as 
an object does have properties and methods that we can work with. Some 
are useful numbers, some are not so useful. Let's take a look at what 
the MAX_VALUE property of the number object will return.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code line 18. The 
code is: slash, slash, p 1, dot inner html, =, accent, dollar sign, open
 curly bracket, Number dot, Max, underscore, Value, close curly bracket,
 accent, semi-colon. He points to the Max value from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to put a comment on line 17 and I'll uncomment line 18.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17. He adds,
 slash slash before p 1. Then he goes to the code line 18. He removes, 
slash slash before p 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh the browser screen, and there you see
 that that's probably the largest number that JavaScript will be allowed
 to work with.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 1.7 9 7 6 9 3 1 3 4 8 6 2 3 1 5 7, e +
 308.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this might come in handy, for example, if you're trying to compare
 some kind of value that a user is going to pass to you and you want to 
make sure that your calculations will be able to handle it. You could 
probably use this MAX_VALUE as some kind of comparative operator, 
comparative operand, I should say. What is a little bit more useful, 
though, are some of the methods that are attached to the number object. 
Take a look at line 19, I'm going to put a comment on line 18 and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 18. He adds, slash slash before p 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>uncomment out line 19.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 19. The code
 is: slash, slash, p 1, dot inner html, =, accent, dollar sign, open 
curly bracket, Number dot, parse, Int, open curved bracket, num 5, close
 curved bracket, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon. he removes, 
slash slash from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, basically, what this is doing is it's taking a string, which is 
8.56 which is enclosed with quotation marks, so it becomes a string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goess to the code line 15. The 
code is: let, num 5, =, open quote, 8 point 5 6, close quote, 
semi-colon. he points, 8 point 5 6, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Pass that string into the parseInt method and the number object using</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the parse Int, open curved bracket, num 5, from the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that parseInt method will then return some kind of value to us. So 
let's save this change, refresh the browser screen, and we see that we 
get 8.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript Number Object. 8.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, basically, it has taken the 8.56 and parsed it as an integer, 
meaning that we'll drop off the 56 and we'll just return 8 in this case.
 The idea here is that it has taken a string and turned it into a 
number, in the first place it'll be a decimal number. Then it went ahead
 and parsed that decimal number, in terms of using a parseInt method, 
and returned to us the 8 in this case. So JavaScript numbers are a 
little bit boring, but they do provide all of the functionality that a 
JavaScript developer would ever need.</p></div>

The Math Object
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: The Math Object. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at the math object 
in JavaScript. On the left of your screen is a Notepad++ application 
opened up and pointing to an html file. That html file has some 
JavaScript in the middle. On the right side of your screen is the Chrome
 browser rendering the html file that you see on the left. The html file
 on the left has the paragraph tag on line 9. And we'll be using the 
inner html of that paragraph tag to display the various properties and 
methods of the Math object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: open angular 
bracket, p, i d,=, double quote, p 1, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The math object comes with JavaScript, and it's absolutely free. It's
 also an intrinsic object, meaning that it performs just like a static 
class in C# or Java. What that means is that we can just use the math 
object. So on line 12, I'm going to access that math object, and we 
access it with an uppercase M.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: p 1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, accent, dollar sign, open close curly bracket, accent, 
semi-colon. Between open close curly bracket, he writes Math.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now, you may have seen me use the POW function before in another 
video which, of course, will raise one number to the power of some other
 number. But the opposite of that is the square root function, so s q r 
t. I can pass to that square root function, let's say, some number and 
save those changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 12, after Math, he 
writes dot s q r t, open curved bracket, 49, close curved bracket. The 
new code here is p 1, dot, inner HTML, =, accent, dollar sign, open 
curly bracket, math, dot s q r t, open curved bracket, 49, close curved 
bracket, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh to browser screen and there is a 7.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ , and
 refreshes the browser. Following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript math Object. 7</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's one method that we can use. There are also properties like,
 for example, the pi property. So if I wanted to see what that looks 
like, I can simply access the pi property in the innerHTML of this 
paragraph tag, save that change, refresh the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 12, he replaces s q r t with, P I.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I must have spelled it wrong, so let's get rid of this. And to 
save that again, refresh your browser screen, there's your 3.1415.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ , and
 Refreshes the browser. Following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript math Object. 3, point 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Another property of the math object is Euler's constant and you may 
need to use that from time to time. But most of the properties really 
relate to logarithms. So you've seen the sqrt, or square root function. 
Let's now take a look at the random function because that is an 
interesting, that's one that you may have to use. So R-A-N-D-O-M, and 
you simply access it without passing any parameters,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 12, he replaces P I with, random open close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>save the change, refresh the browser screen. What the math.random does is it gives you a number between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ , and
 Refreshes the browser. Following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript math Object. 0, point 5 2 8 7 5 1 2 7 4 7 3 7 6 3 2 
4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it is up to the developer to decide what to do with that number 
between 0 and 1. So, for example, if you wanted a number between 0 and 
9, you'll simply multiply whatever math.random gives you by 10.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 12, He writes *, 10, after, random, open close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save that change, refresh the browser screen. Notice I got a different number this time.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ , and
 Refreshes the browser. Following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript math Object. 6, point 3 5 8 8 5 6 9 9 0 3 7 3 5 4 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And every time I refresh the screen, I will get some different number.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The numbers keep on changing when he refreshes the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's the whole purpose of random, you're going to get a random 
number between 0 and 9 in this case. Now, of course, it is up to the 
developer to use something like parseInt to remove the decimal part of 
the number that math.random is giving us. And there are lots of other 
methods like this, there's the min method, the max method. There is 
floor and ceil. And, of course, there are a lot more like abs that you 
may want to use from time to time. So definitely explore all of the 
different methods that math can help us with. But what's interesting 
though is that we can extend JavaScript by, of course, finding libraries
 in the Internet and using those libraries to our advantage. What this 
means is that there are libraries out there on the Internet that, 
depending on the copyright attached to the library, you may be able to 
use it for free. So, for example, there's a particular library that I 
like, financials.js,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 4. The code 
here is: open angular bracket, script, s r c, =, double quote double 
quote, close angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close
 angular bracket. He writes, financials dot j s, between the double 
quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and I can simply use that library, well, of course I'll have to 
create an instance of that library. So I can do something like this, is 
equal to new, now I can use that library, for</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes a new code on line 11. The 
existing code on line 11 shifts to line 12. The new code on line 11 is: 
let, fin Calc, equals New, finance, open close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>example, there's a method in there called a future value. So I do use
 something like finCalc.FV. Then I can pass it the three parameters that
 it needs. So the first would be the interest rate. And I want that 8% 
to occur or to be applied to, let's say, $2,000. And that's going to be 
applied over 36 months.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. He 
writes, fin Calc, dot, F V, open curved bracket, 0 point zero8, comma, 
2000, comma, 36, close curved bracket, in place of, Math, dot, random, 
open close curved bracket, *, 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I save those changes, refresh the browser screen, And I see that in 36 months, my $2,000 would have grown to $2,058.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ , and
 Refreshes the browser. Following text with a number appears on the 
screen: JavaScript math Object. 2058, point 41.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So there are lots of JavaScript libraries that can be used in this 
way. But you could do, of course, the same thing with the free math 
object that you get for free with JavaScript.</p></div>

Working With Date and Time
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Working With Date and Time. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to explore the date and time, 
well, the date object in JavaScript. On the left of your screen is an 
HTML document that's opened up in Notepad++. And on the right of your 
screen is a Chrome browser rendering the document you see on the left. 
That document on the left has some JavaScript between lines 9 and 13. 
There's also a paragraph tag on line 8 that we're going to be using the 
inner</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 8 is: open angular 
bracket, p, id =, double quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket,
 open angular bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>html of to display the various properties and methods of the date 
object. Date and time is a universal concept. So it means that the date 
and time objects that are in JavaScript are probably the same ones that 
are in just about every other programming language on Earth. So 
JavaScript has provided us with several constructor methods, and that 
gives us the flexibility of creating a date object in several different 
ways. One of the easiest way to declare a date object, which will 
actually give you the current date and time, is as you see on line 11.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: let d = new date, open close curve brackets, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in this case, I've established a variable called d, and that d is 
going to hold the new Date object for me. Just by entering this line, 
line 11, let d = new Date(), what I'm going to get being returned from 
the Date object is the current date and time, which you see in the 
browser to the right of your screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on the browser is: Thu, Jun 21, 2018, 10:58:12, GMT-0300, (Atlantic Daylight Time).</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Keep in mind that that date and time that you're looking at is coming
 from the machine that I'm actually working on. I also happen to be in 
the Atlantic Daylight Time zone. So the browser is picking up my 
localized date and time settings. But focusing back on line 11, if I 
were to pass the constructor a number, let's say 0 in this case, what 
the Date object will return to me</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds a 0, between the open close curve brackets on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>is the date as it was in 1970, January 1st, 1970. So let's save the 
change to line 11 where I'm passing in it a 0, let's refresh the browser
 screen, and to be exact, we're getting the end of 1969. So it'd be end 
of 69, beginning of 1970.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on browser shows: Wed, Dec 31, 1969, 20:00:00, GMT-0400, (Atlantic Standard Time).</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's interesting because it means that if we can pass some 
number that is going to be represented by the milliseconds that has 
passed since that date that you see on the right of your screen. And so,
 for example, if I wanted to know date and time is after 153,000 million
 milliseconds has passed since 1969, then I can pass that amount,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces 0 with 1530000000000, in the code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that number, that large number, to the Date object, save those 
changes. Again, I'm still working with line 11, refresh the browser 
screen and we see that it's actually a few days from the time that I'm 
creating this video</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on browser shows: Tue, Jun 26, 2018, 05:00:00, GMT-0300, (Atlantic Daylight Time).</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But on a more practical note, perhaps whenever you create date 
objects, you're probably wanting to do something like date comparison or
 you're perhaps wanting to do some kind of date arithmetic. So it is 
possible, then, to pass to the constructor something like this. So 2018,
 5, 21, save that change,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces the last entered digits within the open close curved brackets on line 11 with, 2018, 5 , 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen, and what I get is June 21st.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on browser shows: Thu, Jun 21, 2018, 00:00:00, GMT-0300, (Atlantic Daylight Time).</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Notice I got June and not May. So it's extremely important that when 
you pass to the Date constructor in JavaScript, the middle number in 
this case is going to be, well, January is actually represented by 0. So
 keep that in mind when you pass a value such as this to the Date 
object. Now, of course, we could also pass some kind of a string to the 
Date object. So I could do something like, let's see, June 21, and let's
 wrap that up into a string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 11. The 
new code is: let d = new Date, open curve bracket, open quote, 2018 June
 21, close quote, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can pass that entire string to the Date constructor and refresh the
 browser screen and we see that we get the same date. In fact, you can 
even turn it around. So let's put the day first, the month after, so 
June, and then the year last.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, 2018 June 21, with 21 June 2018, in the code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the change, refresh the browser screen, and we see we get the 
same date. Of course, you can go ahead to add in a time if you wanted 
to. Now the Date object is an object, so it does have properties and 
methods. And there are several methods that are available to developers 
for working with things like the day of the week, the month, the year, 
or even time. You can work with time as well. So, for example, if I 
wanted to get the year just from the date that I created on line 11, I 
could do something like getFullYear.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. The 
code here is: p1, dot innerHTML = accent, $ sign, open curly bracket, d,
 dot, getFullYear, close curly bracket, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'll save that change, and what I should get back is the 2018 
part. Now, even though I sent to the constructor of my Date object on 
line 11,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 21 June 2018, in the code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I sent it a string, I'm going to get back a numeric value in terms of
 the year. So let's refresh the screen, and I must have forgotten my 
parentheses.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds open close curly brackets after, getFullYear, in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save that change, refresh the browser screen, and notice what I got 
back, just the 2018. So there are several methods like this that are 
available in JavaScript for the Date object. So as you can see, the Date
 object is very simple and very easy to work with in JavaScript.</p></div>

JavaScript let and const Keywords
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: JavaScript let and const Keywords. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we'll discuss const and let. These are the new
 keywords that was introduced in ECMAScript 6. On the screen I have an 
HTML document opened with Notepad++ on the left of your screen. On the 
right of your screen is a browser window that is rendering the file that
 you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following text is displayed on the browser: Final price is 3.2775, Markup is 0.4275, PC_ MARKUP is 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've also got the developer tools opened on the Chrome browser just 
so that we may see any errors that will occur. So, like the name 
suggest, the const key word is used with the intention of not changing 
the value of the variable. On line 12, within the JavaScript of that 
HTML document, I have a const variable called PC_MARKUP and I've given 
it a value of 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: const PC_MARKUP= 15 semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Throughout the entire code, that 15 is being used. And even all the way down to line 22,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 22 is: p1. dot 
innerHTML +=, double quote, open angular bracket, br, slash, close 
angular bracket, PC_MARKUP is, double quote, + PC_MARKUP semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>where I am printing whatever that value is, it turns out to be 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights PC_MARKUP in the code on line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that value never changes. In fact, if we attempted to change that value, so I'm just copying part of line 12.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies PC_MARKUP= 15 semi colon from the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to paste it at where line 15 is now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He pastes the code PC_MARKUP= 15 semi colon on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In other words, I'm trying to re-assign a value to PC_MARKUP. Let's 
save that change. Now even though it's the same value, let's save the 
change, refresh the browser screen and notice that we instantly get an 
error.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> An error message appears within the 
console in the browser. The error message is as follows: Uncaught 
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable at finalPrice(139718 
.HTML:15), at 139718 .html:19</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's put a comment on line 15, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds double slash at the beginning of the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>even at line 24, yeah, line 24 now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 24. The code here is: PC_MARKUP= 15 semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Even if I attempted to change the value all the way down here, save 
that change, refresh the browser screen. Everything worked up to now but
 I still get an error,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On refreshing the browser, the 
following text appears: Final price is 3.2775, Markup is 0.4275, PC_ 
MARKUP is 15. An error message appears within the console in the 
browser. The message is as follows: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to 
constant variable at 139718 .HTML:24.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>meaning that I cannot re-assign PC_MARKUP. So let's put a comment on line 24.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds double slash, at the beginning of the code on line 24. Now, the code here is: double slash, PC_MARKUP= 15 semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, what is interesting though is that with ECMAScript 6, these curly braces now act as its own block scope.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 14. The 
code here is: function finalPrice, open curve bracket, price, close 
curve bracket, open curly bracket. He highlights the open curly bracket 
in the code. He goes to the code on line 18. The code here is: close 
curly bracket, semi colon. He highlights the close curly bracket in the 
code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it means that I could actually create a new constant</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights const, in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>value with the same name within the function called finalPrice.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 15, the presenter replaces double slash with const.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's allowed, in fact, let's change this value to 14, let's 
save those changes, now remember the markup previously was 43 cents.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In line 15, the presenter replaces 15
 with 14 in the code. He refers to the markup value displayed on the 
browser. The value here is: 0.4275.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>With the redefining of PC_MARKUP with the new const keyword, back to 
14. Let's see if this should be a little bit less now, let's refresh the
 browser and notice that it's now about 40 cents.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The value of markup in the browser, changes to 0.3990000000000001.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But of course this makes your code very confusing, so I would strongly suggest that you do not do that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He deletes the code on line 15. The succeeding lines of code shift one place up.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The let keyword is a little more forgiving, and it all depends on 
where that let keyword is used will be the outcome of your code. So in 
this case, we are defining a variable, declaring a variable called 
markup outside of the function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code on line 13. The code here is: let markup = 0, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's see, within this script tag, let's say, from line 11 to line
 23, that's the scope of this particular JavaScript. Meaning that's the 
global scope. And with the let keyword, if I declared something on line 
13, it means that at line 15, where I'm using it within the function,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: markup = price * open curve bracket, PC_MARKUP slash 100 close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it will still retain that value. So up at this point in time, until it calculates, until the calculation is done,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights price * open curve bracket, PC_MARKUP slash 100 close curve bracket, on the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>markup will remain 0. But the idea here is that markup, on line 21, gives me whatever markup value is calculated on line 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 21 is: p1. dot 
innerHTML+=, double quote, open angular bracket, br, slash, close 
angular bracket, Markup, is, double quote, + markup, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But just like with the const keyword, a few minutes ago, I could 
redefine markup. I could actually put a let keyword in front of markup.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 15, the presenter adds let at the beginning of the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now the markup that I have inside of this function is different from the markup</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights markup in the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that I have at the global scope. Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen and notice that my markup is now 0.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The value of markup in the browser changes to 0.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, what that is telling me is that the markup that I'm printing on 
line 21 is actually the markup that I'm getting from line 13. So, the 
value 0 has been passed all the way down to line 21. Within the 
function, markup was calculated correctly.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the markup on the code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But we never knew what that markup was because of the redefinition 
that took place. So depending on what you're trying to do, this ability 
to redefine a variable in a different place may actually be an advantage
 for you.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes let from the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But in my case here, I do want my markup to retain the original 
markup that I declared on line 13. So let's make that change again, 
refresh the browser screen and now we're back to the original problem 
that we had.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On refreshing the browser, the value of the markup changes to 0.4275.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So generally though, let would be used for a mathematical or 
arithmetic type of operations as well as loops. And in terms of the 
const keyword, although, I have declared a variable on line 12 as that 
value being 15. The const keyword can actually point to more complex 
objects. In fact, it can point to array type objects. And in that case, 
the values of that object may be changed. However, the way we're using 
it here, the intention of this const keyword is to not change our 
PC_MARKUP variable.</p></div>

Keyed Collections
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Keyed Collections. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at keyed 
collections in JavaScript. This is a new ECMAScript 6 addition to the 
language. As usual, I have an HTML document opened in Notepad++ with 
JavaScript between lines 11 and 19. To the right of that is a Chrome 
browser rendering the file that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text is displayed on the browser: JavaScript Keyed Collections.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, JavaScript has several collections to choose from, the array 
being the simplest and easiest to work with. But EC6 introduced 
something called keyed collections, and these types of collections use 
some kind of a value to point to a map to some other value. If you think
 of associative arrays, well, some of these are very similar to that. 
They are called keyed collections because the ECMAScript people wanted 
us to differentiate between these types of collections and what are 
called indexed collections, like the arrays that we are familiar with. 
So they introduced three types of keyed collections. Two of them are 
really more important, so the maps and sets are the most important ones.
 So I'll just talk about those for this demonstration. What I have on 
the screen starting at line 13 is a map collection,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: var, myMap,=, new Map, open close curved brackets, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it's a keyed collection. And as you can see on line 13, I've declared
 a new map. So we can think of it as a myMap object. And I've set some 
of the various parameters to these values that I talked about. So for 
example, crystal is pointing to clear on line 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is: myMap dot 
set, open curved bracket, open quote, crystal, close quote, comma, open 
quote, clear, close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 15, 8, which is a string, is pointing to null.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: myMap dot 
set, open curved bracket, open quote, 8, close quote, comma, Null, close
 curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the idea here of course is to show that you could put just about
 any data type into these collections, even other objects. So let's take
 a look now at how I can iterate over the myMap object. So starting on 
line 19, what I'm going to do is I'm going to invoke for each function 
of the myMap object. And I'm going to pass to that function. I'm going 
to pass to that, well, yeah for each method, I'm going to pass it 
another function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 19. The 
code is: myMap.forEach, open curved bracket, function, open close curved
 brackets, open close curly brackets, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then I'm going to pass within that function, I'm going to pass to the using parameters, the item, key and map object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 19. The 
new code is: myMap.forEach, open curved bracket, function, open curved 
bracket, item, comma, key, comma, mapObj close curved bracket, open 
close curly brackets, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So item and key relate to the values that are established within the 
myMap object. Now, once I have this function established, I'm going to 
have to define what the function does. So for now I'm going to use the 
inner html of my p1 tag that I declared on line 9. I'm going to add to 
that space on the browser window and I'm going to send it the key. And 
within the key, because of the fact that we can have other objects 
within sets, I'm going to turn everything into a string. So I'm going to
 take my key and turn it into a string before I send it off to the 
browser. Then I'm going to add to that a break tag so that each of these
 keys are printed on a different line.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 20. The 
code is: p 1 dot inner Html, + = , keydot to, String, open close curved 
bracket, +, double quote, open angular bracket, br space, slash, close 
angular bracket, double quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just that change, let's save those changes, refresh the 
browser screen and there you see the various keys that are in my 
collection. If you wanted to change the items instead,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ and refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: Crystal 8. Seven 50.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>you will simply remove key from the line 20 and put the word item in 
there, and then you'll get things like clear and null, so you'll get the
 values as such. So let's now talk about sets. And sets are declared and
 initialized almost exactly as maps, so we can just follow what we did 
on line 13, and I can do something like let mySet = new Set(), and right
 there I have a mySet object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 22. The code is: let mySet = new Set, open close curved brackets, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, sets work a little bit differently from maps in that we'll use 
the object itself, but then we'll invoke the add method. So mySet.add 
will allow me to start adding to this collection. And once again, you 
can add just about any data type to the mySet object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 23. The code is: mySetdot, add, open close curved brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in the first instance here, I'm probably going to add a string, so let's add a string to that set.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 23, he writes, open quote, monday, close quote, between the open close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the good news about sets is that you can continue chaining your 
add methods. So right after the closing parentheses on line 23, I can 
simply use a period and then attach the add method to what I had before.
 And in this case, I can add a number if I wanted to.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 23, he writes, period add, open curved bracket, 56, close curved bracket, after the existing code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can continue like this, I can add even more stuff. For example, I'm
 adding a boolean type, and finally, I'm going to add an undefined.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 23, he writes, period 
add, open curved bracket, true, close curved bracket, period add, open 
curved bracket, undefined, close curved bracket, semi-colon after the 
existing code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have just added about four items to mySet. Now, these objects do
 have properties as well. And one of the better properties that, one of 
the more important properties we can use, for example, for set is the, 
well, on line 24 I'm going to use the inner html again. And I'm going to
 use my mySet object and I'm going to access the size property of that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 24. The code is: p 1 dotinner Html, + =, mySetdot, size, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and you see 
that I get 4, meaning that I have now 4 items in my set itself.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ and refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: Crystal 8. Seven 50. 4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Iteration is also done nicely with sets. But with this particular 
set, I'm going to use a for off loop. So on line 25, I'm going to set 
that up. Let's set up a for loop, and within the parentheses of the for 
loop, and I know I need to set up a variable. So I'm going to use let, 
and then I'm going to use the of keyword. Once I have that set up, then 
I'm going to say I'm want to let my key, this could be any variable that
 you want, of my set. Now, mySet can't change, it has to be the set that
 you're working with. And now I'm going to define what the 4 is all 
about. But for this I am going to use the console window. So on line 26,
 I am going to set up my console.log, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 25. The 
code is: for, open curved bracket, let myKey of mySet, close curved 
bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to pass to that log myKey.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 26. The code is: consoledotlog, open curved bracket, myKey, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes and refresh the browser screen. Now, you 
don't see the log showing up, but if I hit F12 to get to the developer 
tools, you'll see the various keys that are showing up, or values.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ and 
refreshes the browser. The following text appears on the screen: Crystal
 8. Seven 50. 4. He hits the F12 Button. The console window opens up 
with the following text: Monday, 56, true, undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in this case, it's Monday 56 through true and undefined. Though 
there is one more collection, which is a WeakMap. But it's not so 
important, so I just wanted to concentrate on these first two that are a
 little bit more useful.</p></div>

Async Functions and Promises
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: async Functions and Promises. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration I'm going to be talking about async functions. 
The promise object as well as the await keyword in JavaScript. On the 
left of your screen I have an HTML document opened in Notepad++ with 
JavaScript in the middle. On the right of your screen there's a Chrome 
browser rendering the document you see on the left. The HTML document is
 very simple. We have JavaScript on line 19, I'm calling a function 
called showMe. You see that function declared and defined on line 11.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 19 is: showMe, open 
curve bracket, simpleF, open close curve brackets, close curve brackets,
 semi colon. The code on line 11 is: let showMe = function, open curve 
bracket, y, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And within the parameter of the showMe function, I'm passing in yet another function that is declared on line 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: function simpleF open close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, basically one function is calling another function and you see 
the result of all of that on the Chrome browser on the right of your 
screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: Just executed!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this demonstration is about async functions, and about await 
keyboard and the promise object. And basically what that is, is whenever
 we are on the Internet, JavaScript sometimes has to wait for some other
 process to complete. A typical example is the JavaScript is waiting for
 some service on some other website in some other part of the world, 
like maybe a JSON return object. And in order for the process to 
continue working, the ECMAScript people had to come up with some way of 
allowing this to happen. So they came up with this structure of using a 
promise object within an async function and then an await keyboard. So 
what I'm going to do is turn the simpleF function into an async 
function. And in order to do that, all I really have to do is include 
the async keyword in front of the function. And that's it, that's all 
that I have to do to make this function, simpleF function, an async 
function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds async at the beginning of the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What that means is that the function itself will return a promise 
object which in itself will have some type of value. That value will 
only be returned if the promise object was fulfilled. In other words it 
was resolved. So with just this one change with making this simpleF 
function an async function, if I save that change, refresh the browser 
screen, notice what I get back, a promise object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: open square bracket, object Promise, close square bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Remember, that promise object has a value, that value is called just returned.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 16. The 
code here is: return, open quote, Just executed! close quote, semi 
colon. He highlights Just executed! in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, in order for me to see all of this, I will have to restructure 
the call to my simpleF function. So instead of calling I'm changing line
 19 and I'm going to invoke the simpleF method. And because that simpleF
 method will return a promise object, I know the object has a then 
method, which will then be called once the promise has been resolved. So
 within the parameter of that promise object, I can do other tasks. So, 
I'm telling the object in this case to run the showMe method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 19. The 
new code here is: simpleF, open close curve brackets, dot, then, open 
curve bracket, showMe, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh to browser screen, and now I get just
 executed. Now in order to make this a little bit more explicit, I can 
actually return a promise object explicitly. And I know that I am 
accessing the resolve method because I'm assuming that the promise was 
resolved and not rejected.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 16. The 
code here is: return Promise dot resolve, open curve bracket, open 
quote, Just Executed! close quote, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the change and refresh the browser screen and we see that the message is the same.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: Just Executed!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In fact, I can actually take this a little bit further, I can create a new promise object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 16. The succeeding lines of code shift one place below.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let promise with lowercase p = new Promise. And within the 
constructor of that promise object, I can pass an anonymous function 
which will handle whether the promise was rejected or I should say, 
whether it was resolved or it was rejected.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new code on line 16 is: let 
promise = new Promise, open curve bracket, function, open curve bracket,
 resolve, comma, reject, close curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi 
colon. In the code, the letter p, in the first instance of promise is in
 lower case, and the letter p, in the second instance of promise is in 
upper case.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now within the body of that function, I can say, if it was resolved 
then I would want to pass a value back to the caller and that value is 
actually going to be the same message that I want printed out to the 
screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new line of code on line 17. 
The code here is: resolve, open curve bracket, open quote, Just 
executed! close quote, close curve bracket, semi colon. He adds a new 
code on line 18. The code here is: close curly bracket, close curve 
bracket, semi colon. The succeeding lines of code shift two places 
below. The code on line 19 is: return, Promise dot resolve, open curve 
bracket, open quote, Just executed! close quote, close curve bracket, 
semi colon. The code on line 20 is, close curly bracket. The code on 
line 21 is, double slash. The code on line 22 is: simpleF, open close 
curve brackets, dot, then, open curve bracket, showMe, close curve 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now that I have a new promise object inside of the simpleF function itself, I don't need to return anything.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds double slash at the beginning of the code on line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if I'm not going to return anything, then I can't access the then
 method of that object, because that object is not being returned to me 
anymore.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He deletes the following portion from the code on line 22: dot, then, open curve bracket, showMe, close curve bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So all I can do right now is call the simpleF function, let the 
function create that object. If the promise object was resolved then a 
message will be passed back to the caller, so where do we want that 
message to go? Well at this point in time I'm not actually calling the 
showMe function anywhere. So within the simpleF function, I can now call
 the showMe method and I can pass it the object that I just created.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 
19. The code here is: showMe, open curve bracket, promise, close curve 
bracket, semi colon. The succeeding lines of code shift one place below.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can save these changes. Now, I know the code won't work exactly, 
but let's just see what has happened so far. If I refresh the browser 
screen, I do get promise object, which is great.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: open square bracket, object Promise, close square bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The problem is that the promise was never resolved. We were simply 
getting an object and it was never told to do what it was supposed to 
do. So in order for me to force promise to give up its value, I would 
have to use the await keyword.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds await before promise in the code on line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save the changes, refresh your browser screen, now I'm getting the message back.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: Just executed!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But I still haven't shown how this would work on the Internet. Well, 
on the Internet we always waiting for something to happen. So that's the
 promise. The promise is, did this thing happen or did it not happen? I 
can simulate what happens on the Internet with the use of a setTimout 
function. So I can set timeout and setTimeout always takes a function 
that will be fired after so many seconds, so whatever. And basically 
what I'm going to do is wrap up everything inside of this set function. 
And I'm going to say, okay, after two seconds.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 17. The 
code here is: setTimeout, open curve bracket, function, open close curve
 brackets, open curly bracket, resolve, open curve bracket, open quote, 
Just executed! close quote, close curve bracket, semi colon, close curly
 bracket, comma, 2000, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So after two seconds, the resolve part of this promise object will 
fire. So let's save those changes, refresh the browser screen, wait two 
seconds, and there's your answer.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser: Just executed!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the async function works nicely when we have to wait on something from the Internet.</p></div>

Hoisting
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Hoisting. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about hoisting in 
JavaScript. I have on the screen an HTML document, on the left, and it 
has some JavaScript between lines 9 and 13. On the right of your screen 
is a Chrome browser rendering the file you see on</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser the following text is present: JavaScript Hoisting. num 1 is 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the left. The HTML document on the left of your screen is very 
typical to what happens when using the var keyword. Remember, we can 
also use the var keyword to declare variables, to initialize them, etc. 
So when using the var keyword, typically you would declare a variable, 
and then afterwards access that variable. So the declaration happens on 
line 11, and on line 12 we are accessing that variable. And on the right
 side of the screen, you see exactly what would happen. But it is also 
possible to do something like this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line11. The code is: var, num 1, =, 6, semi-colon. he highlights, var, num1, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can make my declaration below where I'm actually accessing that declaration.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The code is: var, num 1. He goes to the code line 11. He removes, var from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 11 I have assignment, on line 12 I'm accessing the variable,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12. The code
 is: p1, dot inner html, =, accent, num 1 is, dollar sign, open curly 
bracket, num 1, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and on line 13 I am declaring that variable. Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. He adds, semi-colon after num 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>notice that it works just like it did before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and refreshes the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The reason is that line 13 where the declaration is made, in JavaScript,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. He highlights the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it is hoisted to the top of the code. Meaning that, in memory, 
JavaScript has already understood that there's a num1 available 
somewhere inside of this code. So by the time it gets to line 11, num1 
is already established, so we can now do assignments. The thing is that 
if we were to do the declaration and the assignment, before we attempt 
to access the code,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 11. He 
removes, =, 6, semi-colon from the code. He goes to the code line 13, 
and adds = 6 semi-colon after num 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>so I've just changed line 12 to be declaration and assignment.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He deletes the code on line 11. Now 
the code line 12 shifted to the code line 11. He goes to the code line 
12. He highlights, num 1 &amp;, 6 from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, line 11, I'm accessing that variable, let's save the changes, refresh the browser screen and what we get is undefined.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the 
screen: Num 1 is undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The reason is that only declarations are hoisted not assignment, not 
initialization, well, actually, I do have an extra semicolon there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12. He removes, extra semi-colon from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh the browser screen, we still get 
undefined. It's interesting to note that variables declared with a let 
and const are hoisted within their respective code blocks. Now, this 
aspect of hoisting also works with functions. Let's change our line 11, 
instead of accessing a variable, let's access a Num1, Function, and I'll</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 11, the 
new code is: p1 dot innerHTML = accent num1 is $ sign, open curly 
bracket, getNum1, open close curved brackets, close curly bracket, 
accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>write my function underneath so, On line 12 I will start writing that
 function. So getNum1 will return to us the number 6, in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 12. The 
code is: function, get num 1, open close curved brackets, open curly 
bracket. He goes to the code line 13. He points to the number 6. He 
declares a code on line 14. The code is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm returning a 6, let's save those changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code line 13. The new code is: return 6, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen, notice that it works.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and refreshes the browser. The following text with a number appears on the screen: Num 1 is 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So once again, the function declared on line 12 is hoisted once the 
JavaScript compiler goes through this code, meaning that it's added to 
memory.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12. he points function from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So by the time we get to line 11, the getNum1 call is already known. 
Compiler already knows that this function exists and it knows where to 
go get the return value.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 11. He highlights get num 1, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now what is interesting is that after ES6, ECMAScript introduced the 
class keyword. Now, I've been saying all along that classes do not 
really exist in JavaScript. What I mean is that the classes don't exist 
in the sense of Java or C#. The keyword class does exist, and what that 
denotes is a special function in JavaScript. And what's interesting is 
that this hoisting feature does not apply to classes even though it's a 
special function. So let's change our line 12, where my initial function
 was, let's change that using the class keyword.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. The new code is: class, getNum1, open close curved bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in other words, I'm creating a class called get1, and that class is going to have a constructor in it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In code line 12, he removes, open close curved brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that constructor is going to do some kind of an assignment.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The 
code is: constructor, open close curved brackets, open curly bracket. He
 declares a code on line 15. The code is: close curly bracket. He also 
goes to the code line 14. he highlights, return in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We're going to create a property and I'm going to say that this.x = 6.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 14, the new code is: this dot x = 6, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now that I have a class, again, which is a special function, I can 
create an instance of that class. So I can say something like getNum = 
new getNum1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 11. The 
code is: get num, =, new get Num1, open close curved brackets, 
semi-colon. The existing code on line 11 shifts to line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now that I have an instance, I can use the getNum instance to access the property.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. The 
new code is: p1 dot innerHTML = accent num1 is $ sign, open curly 
bracket, getNum1 dot x, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let’s save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Now we don't 
see anything on the screen, but if I hit F12, we will see the error, 
getNum1 is not defined.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++, and 
refreshes the browser. No change appears on the screen. He hits F12 
button, the console windows opens up with the following error: Uncaught 
referenceError :. get num 1 is not defined at 1 3 9 7 2 1 dot, html, 
colon, 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that means that hoisting does not apply to classes. However, if I 
were to remove lines 13 to 17, which is my entire class, so if I remove 
it from where it is and put it above where I created an instance</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, and removes the codes from line 13 to 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>of that class, save those changes, refresh the browser screen, now it works.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He places the code lines removed from
 lines 13 to 17, to, code line 11 to 15. He saves the codes in 
notepad++, and refreshes the browser. The following text with a number 
appears on the screen: JavaScript Hoisting. Num 1 is 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the bottom line is to understand hoisting. And that whenever you 
declare variables, definitely go ahead and do the assignment at the same
 time and always declare and assign variables before you actually use 
them.</p></div>

String Padding
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: String Padding. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about two new specifications
 from ES6, padStart and padEnd. On the screen, I have an HTML document 
opened in Notepad++. There's some JavaScript between lines 10 and 15. On
 the right of your screen is a Chrome browser rendering the file that 
you see on the left. I've also got the Console window opened, by hitting
 F12 on the Chrome browser, you will see the developer tools. And there 
is a Console window there that we can see any output. So let's take a 
look at the JavaScript code on line 11 and 12.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: x, =, open 
quote, 123.45, close quote, semi-colon. The code on line 12 is: console,
 dot log, open curved bracket, Y, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>There's a variable called x, and actually I should declare that 
variable a little bit better. So let's use our let, and in this case, we
 are printing x to the console.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 11, he writes: let, before the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change, refresh the browser, make sure nothing has changed.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser . Following text is curremtly on the screen: 
JavaScript Padding in JS.. Under developer console window, following 
text with the numbers is currently on the screen: 123.45. 1 3 9 7 2 2, 
dot html, colon, 12. The presenter points out that no change has taken 
place.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And, basically, as the word suggests, with padding what you're trying
 to do is align things together. And this is especially important if you
 have several items that you're trying to</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 8. The code 
is: open angular bracket, h 3, i d, =, double quote, old, double quote, 
close angular bracket, JavaScript Padding in JS., Open angular bracket, 
slash, h 3, close angular bracket. He highlights padding in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>line up somehow. It's just easier on the eyes if things are a little 
bit more tabular. So in order to apply the padStart to any string 
object, you simply attach the padStart. And you would pass it two 
arguments. If you pass it one argument, let's say in this case I wanted 
to pass it a 10, the second argument will assumed to be the space 
character.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies code on line 12. The new 
code is, console, dot log, open curved bracket, x dot padStart, open 
curved bracket, 10, closed curved bracket, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the JavaScript does have the ability to print space characters 
onto the browser screen. But I noticed that it wasn't giving me the 
effect that I wanted so I'm using the console window. So let's save this
 change. Now, notice what's going to happen to our value down at the 
bottom.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and on the browser page, Under developer console window, he points to 
the following number: 123.45.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I refresh the browser screen, notice that it's going to jump to the right and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser, Under developer console window, the following number moves 10 spaces to the right: 123.45.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it jumped 10 spaces. So if you wanted to see exactly what that second
 parameter would do, let's pass to padStart second parameter of the 
asterisk.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies code on line 12. The new 
code is, console, dot log, open curved bracket, x dot padStart, open 
curved bracket, 10, comma, open quote, asterisk, close quote, closed 
curved bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the change, refresh the browser screen, notice that it padded four asterisk characters to the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and on the browser page, Under developer console window, following 
number appears: Four times asterisk, 123.45.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's because the number that we have, although it's five 
numbers, we do have a period there that takes up one more space. So 
these are actually six spaces, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> he highlights, 123.45 in the browser console.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we are padding to the left four spaces with the second parameter. 
PadEnd works almost exactly like padStart, except that the padding will 
happen to the right of the value.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. The code
 is: slash, slash, Y, =, open quote, 123.45, close quote, semi-colon. He
 removes, slash, slash, from the code. He goes to the code line 14. The 
code is: Slash, slash, console dot log, open curved bracket, Y, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon. He removes, slash, slash, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have another value here, y, and we are going to pad, or we are 
going to log y as well. Let's do it without any padding at all, so I 
just save the changes. Refresh your browser screen, and there's our 
second value.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser . Under developer console window, following 
text with the numbers appears on the screen: Four times Asterisk, 
123.45. 139722.html : 12. 123.45. 139722.html : 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But if I padded that to the end, so let's y.padEnd. And I'm going to pad it, let's see, the same 10 amount.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies code on line 14. The new 
code is: console dot log, open curved bracket, Y dot padEnd, open curved
 bracket, 10, close curved bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save those changes, refresh the browser screen. Notice nothing 
happens, and that's fine. Nothing is supposed to happen, because I'm 
padding everything over to the left. So that means that the value will 
be left justified. Now to see that a little bit better, what I could do 
is I could copy lines 13 and 14, paste it. And let's create yet a third 
value, let's say z in this case,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies the code line 13 &amp; 14, &amp; pastes them below line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and let's give it some kind of a bigger number, so .67.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code line 15, He replaces the Y- with- Z, And, 1 2 3, period 4 5 with, 1 2 3 4 5, period 6 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And let's pad our z with the same 10 spaces, save the changes, 
refresh the browser screen. And there you see that even though we have 
more characters in the second value, it's still left aligned.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. JavaScript Padding in JS. Under developer 
console window, following text with the numbers appears on the screen: 
Four times Asterisk, 123.45. 139722.html : 12. 123.45. 139722.html : 14.
 1 2 3 4 5, period 6 7. 139722.html : 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if we wanted to actually use that second parameter, we could of 
course pass it any character we wish. Refresh the screen, and when you 
check all of these numbers, you should get 10.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 16, the 
new code is: console dot log, open curved bracket, Y dot padEnd, open 
curved bracket, 10, comma, open quote, dash, close quote, close curved 
bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon. He, then saves the codes in 
notepad++ file, and refreshes the browser. JavaScript Padding in J S. 
Under developer console window, following text with the numbers appears 
on the screen: Four times Asterisk, 123.45. 139722.html : 12. 123.45. 
139722.html : 14. 1 2 3 4 5, period 6 7 dash dash. 139722.html : 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So again, padding is useful when you are dealing with tabular output.</p></div>

Exercise: JavaScript Events
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Exercise: JavaScript Events. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create an HTML document with one H3 tag, 
two paragraph tags, and one button. When the button is clicked, write 
two functions that will alert a message. So we're going to be calling 
both of these functions together in one click. When the mouse is hovered
 over the H3 tag, change the wording of the other paragraph tags by 
targeting and changing their innerHTML values. Use an external 
JavaScript file when you're doing this exercise. You may now pause the 
video, attempt this exercise, and then return to the video to see how I 
would approach the tasks at hand. So the first thing that we needed to 
do was create an HTML document with one</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A notepad ++ with an HTML file, and a
 Scripts.js file is open. The presenter is currently on the HTML file. A
 browser rendering the file in notepad ++ is also open.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>H3 tag, and two paragraph tags, as well as one button event, one button itself.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 8. The 
code here is: open angular bracket, h3, onmouseover = double quote, 
double quote, id, = double quote, old, double quote, close angular 
bracket, JavaScript Events, open angular bracket, forward slash, h3, 
close angular bracket. He highlights h3 in the code. He refers to the 
code on lines 9, 10, and 12. The code on line 9 is: open angular 
bracket, p, id, = double quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket,
 This is a paragraph, open angular bracket, forward slash, p, close 
angular bracket. The code on line 10 is: open angular bracket, p, id, = 
double quote, p2, double quote, close angular bracket, This is another 
paragraph, open angular bracket, forward slash, p, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 12 is: open angular bracket, button, onclick =
 double quote, double quote, close angular bracket. He highlights open 
angular bracket, p, in the code on lines 9 and 10, and button, in the 
code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, there's a Chrome browser rendering the file that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text can be seen on the
 browser: This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph. There is also a
 button titled, Button On-click event.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now I went ahead and I accessed the various events, so h3, we needed 
do a mouseover event, and for the button, we needed to do an onclick 
event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, onmouseover, =, double
 quote, double quote, in the code on line 8. He then highlights onclick 
in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What we need to do now is wire up all of this to the JavaScript file.
 If you notice on line 4, I am pointing to a Scripts.js file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket, script, src = double quote, Scripts.js, double quote, close 
angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I move over to my Scripts.js file, let's start writing these functions one at a time.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the Scripts.js file in notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first function that I'm going to work on is the button click 
event. So I know it's a function, so let me go ahead and start on line 1
 of that JavaScript file with the word function. Then I can define that 
function, or declare that function, as message1. Remember, there are 
going to two messages that are going to be fired when we click the 
event. Now that I have my function all declared, and I have my curly 
braces and everything, I can now use those curly braces to access the 
JavaScript built-in function called alert. I know that alert takes a 
parameter of string and I can pass to that alert function whatever I 
need to have it say in the pop up box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds codes in lines, 1, 2 and 3, 
The code on line 1 is: function message1, open close curve brackets, 
open curly bracket. The code on line 2 is: alert, open curve bracket, 
open quote, You have just witnessed an event in JS!, close quote, close 
curve bracket, semi colon. The code on line 3 is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, I've already got one function done. I'm going to save my changes.
 I'm going to go back to my HTML document and on the onclick event of</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the HTML file and highlights the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that button, I am going to access, or wire up, my first function. So,
 let's go back to the JavaScript file for a second, grab the message1, 
or</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to scripts.js file and copies message1, from the code on line 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>copy it, and then I'm going to paste it in the onclick event. I'm going to use my parenthesis, because it is a function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the HTML file and 
modifies the code on line 12. Now, the code on line 12 is: open angular 
bracket, button, onclick = double quote, message1, open close curve 
brackets, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the browser screen, click on the button, and there's my first message.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Button On-click Event in
 the browser. A pop-up with the following text appears: This page says: 
You have just witnessed an event in JS!. There is also an OK button on 
the pop-up box.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Great, so I'll click OK to get rid of the message. Go back to my 
JavaScript file, now all I really need to do is copy this first 
function. So it's made up of three lines at the moment, so I'll copy all
 three lines,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to scripts.js file and copies the codes from lines 1-3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and I'll paste it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He pastes the copied codes on lines 4, 5 and 6.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll change the name of my message to message2, and I'll give it some
 other message, you have just witnessed maybe another event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the codes on line 4 and 
5. On line 4, he replaces message1 with message2 in the code, and on 
line 5, he replaces the text an, with another, in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it's a different message. I'll save the changes to my JavaScript 
file, go back to my HTML. Now the question is how do I call two 
functions from one onclick event?</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the html file and highlights message1, open close curve brackets in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the answer is that we separate them by a semicolon.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a semi colon after the open close curve brackets in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So my other function call will be message1, actually message2, so 
let's change that 1 to a 2, include my parentheses, as well as another 
semicolon.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12. Now,
 the code here is: open angular bracket, button, onclick = double quote,
 message1, open close curve brackets, semi colon, message2, open close 
curve brackets, semi colon, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with one onclick event, we can actually access two different 
functions in JavaScript. Let's save all of these changes, refresh the 
browser screen, click on that button. There's our first message. I'll 
click OK, and there's a second message. I'll click OK to get rid of 
that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A pop-up box with following text 
appears: This page says: You have just witnessed an event in JS!. There 
is also an OK button on the pop-up box. The presenter clicks on Ok, and 
another message appears in the pop-up box. The second message is: This 
page says: You have just witnessed another event in JS!. The presenter 
clicks on the OK button to remove the pop-up box.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The next thing we wanted to do was create a mouseover event over 
this, the h3 tag in this case, our h3 tag that says JavaScript Events.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 8. He 
then shifts to the browser and highlights the title of the rendered 
file. The title is: JavaScript Events. In the HTML file, he highlights 
JavaScript Events in the code on line 8.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And while I'm mousing over that h3 tag, I need these two paragraphs to change, so p1 and p2 should change.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the HTML file, he refers to the codes on lines 9 and 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to go back to my JavaScript file again, I'm going to 
write another function. So basically what I'm going to do is copy my 
last function, paste it, and just change the name. So let's change it to
 something like rollOver, with an uppercase O.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the Scripts.js file, and
 copies the codes written on line 4, 5, and 6. He then pastes them on 
the lines 7, 8 and 9. The presenter then modifies the code on line 7. 
Now, the code on line 7 is: function rollOver, open close curve 
brackets, open curly bracket. The O in rollOver is in upper case.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I don't want to call an alert this time, but I'm going to 
actually access the innerHTML of my p1 tag. So, for that, I'm going to 
have to use the document.getElementById, document.getElementById, and I 
need to tell JavaScript which element I'm looking for. And in this case,
 I am looking for my p1 tag. Then I'm going to access the innerHTML of 
that p1 tag. And I'm going to pass to that innerHTML some message, 
something like, You have changed.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 8 to: 
document.getElementById, open curve bracket, double quote, p1, double 
quote, close curve bracket, .innerHTML = double quote, You have changed,
 double quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now I need to do that for the second paragraph as well. So what I'm 
going to do is I'll copy the first document.getElementBy line, and paste
 it underneath it. And all I really need to do is change the p1 tag to 
the p2, in this case, because it is the name of the second paragraph 
tag. And I can say something like You have changed also. I'll save all 
of these changes, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies the code on line 8 and 
pastes it on line 9. He then modifies the code on line 9. The code here 
is: document.getElementById, open curve bracket, double quote, p2, 
double quote, close curve bracket, .innerHTML = double quote, You have 
changed also, double quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>now we need to fire that event from our HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the HTML file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on the mouseover event, what I need to have called is my rollOver 
method. Save it, save all changes, refresh that browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 8. Now, 
the code here is: open angular bracket, h3, onmouseover = double quote, 
rollOver, open close curve brackets, semi colon, double quote, id, = 
double quote, old, double quote, close angular bracket, JavaScript 
Events, open angular bracket, forward slash, h3, close angular bracket. 
He highlights h3 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, when I move my mouseover, it should change, and there you see both changes happening.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The text in the browser changes to: You have changed. You have changed also.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div>
