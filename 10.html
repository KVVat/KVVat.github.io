Full Stack Fundamentals
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Full Stack Fundamentals. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to look at JavaScript Front-End Web 
Development, or Full Stack Fundamentals. The thing is there's really no 
hard and fast definition for full stack development. It really depends 
on some kind of context, and even the context changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A pyramid is displayed on the screen.
 It is divided into following 6 tiers: 1st, Front End. 2nd, I S, H t ml,
 C S S. 3rd, Server Side Logic. 4th, Windows, Mac, Linux. 5th, Back end.
 6th, Databases.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In terms of Web development, then what we're looking at. The context 
in which we can discuss full stack development involved around the 
Internet and the World Wide Web. Then we can think of some of the tools 
that we use to access the World Wide Web. We need a computer, we need a 
browser, we need an operating system. So that's what we're looking at 
when we're talking about full stack development. So we can look at it, 
then, from three parts. Or we can look at full stack development as 
having three layers.</p>
<p>The front end layer, that's your browser-based stuff. That's your 
browser and how it operates, what it needs to present, the images and 
text that it's presenting. Then there's a server side part of it. That's
 your operating system-based programming languages. So things like PHP, 
and C#, and those other types of scripting languages on the server side.
 Of course, most website would need a database back-end, so that's the 
third layer. And once we look at full stack development that's having 
three layers. Then we can of course drill down into these layers a 
little bit further.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: F S D - Stack Layers.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That front end layer where we are representing information on a 
browser. That's the layer that encompasses HTML, CSS, and the 
JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> HTML or CSS have 2 sub points: CSS Box Model. Bootstrap. Java Script has 2 sub points: J query. React or Angular JS.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So HTML and CSS that's the structure at the presentation layer. 
JavaScript is considered to be a browser-based scripting language. So 
JavaScript will interact with your HTML to make things happen on the 
browser itself. Then there are the server side languages that support 
your front end part. So these things like PHP, Ruby, Python, even C#. 
These are the languages that would support your HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. In fact, you would need a server side language in order to 
interact with the database. Which is the third layer of our three part, 
or three layer set up. Now, of course, we can have a webpage or website 
without a database.</p>
<p>But most of the sophisticated ones would have some kind of database. 
Because your website would want to collect information from the user. As
 well as present the user with information or specific information that 
the user is requesting. That sort of back and forth would require some 
type of a persistence layer. Now, of course, these three layers that I 
just mentioned is not the entire story. Of course we would want more 
support than that. And being a full stack developer, these are the three
 core parts of being a full stack developer. Now of course, if you know 
something about HTTP and REST then that's even better. This is the layer
 that sort of pulls everything together and makes everything happen. 
They operate at the sort of a network layer. But nevertheless you need 
to have some knowledge about HTTP and about REST.</p>
<p>Then any good web developer, a full Stack web developer, would have 
an excellent knowledge of the entire application. This is the entire 
system that your website is running on. So we're talking web server 
software, things like IIS or Apache. We're also looking at the operating
 system, the file systems within the operating system. So this is where 
the web developer would interact with the systems person, whoever that 
is and whatever his title is. It could be systems developer, systems 
administrator. It could even be the network administrator. So a full 
stack developer is not expected to have excellent or expert knowledge in
 any one particular area. For example, jQuery, you can spend years in 
just using jQuery alone. But a full stack developer is expected to have a
 general understanding, a good understanding of the overall picture. The
 overall architecture that makes up a website and allows that website to
 function.</p></div>

JavaScript for Front End Development 
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: JavaScript for Front End Development. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to describe what JavaScript front end development is and where it fits in to full stack development.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen title: Java Script history and Definitions.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But I'd like to first talk a little but about the history of 
JavaScript. JavaScript was developed at Netscape in or around 1995 and 
it became part of the second version of their Navigator browser in 1996.
 JavaScript actually became an ECMA standard in 1997 and the standard 
was given the official name of ECMA-262. And so ECMAScript is the 
official name of the language. However, JavaScript is just one 
implementation of ECMAScript.</p>
<p>There are other scripts out there. The thing is JavaScript became so 
popular that now several desktop and server side programs use 
JavaScript, like Node.js for example. In fact, even some databases like 
MongoDB and CouchDB, they had to use some language to interact with 
their data, and their tables, and their database objects, and so on. And
 so they decided to use JavaScript for that part of our database. In 
terms of learning JavaScript, well, there is good news.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen title: Java Script - Features.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>JavaScript is part of those C-Style languages, like C++, C#, Java. So
 the structure should be very familiar to learners and to other 
developers. So the syntax is very similar to all of these different 
languages. JavaScript is dynamic, meaning that the user can have a 
better experience on a web page or website due to the functionality and 
dynamism of JavaScript. In fact, quite a lot of processing of user data 
can be done on the browser before that data reaches the back end. And 
JavaScript is responsible for all of this processing.</p>
<p>Each time we fill out a form on the Internet, we are probably seeing 
JavaScript at work, verifying our data, providing us with a path to 
completion of that form. JavaScript is also object oriented, in that we 
can create objects and work with objects just like in other 
object-oriented languages like C++ and Java. JavaScript's implementation
 of objects though might be a little bit different at first or it 
appears different at first. But in the end, what we have is an object, 
and an object behaves just like other objects in other languages. So 
what all of this means is that we have the power to deal with or to work
 with structure of an HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: Full Stack Development - Java Script.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>JavaScript interacts with the structure of an HTML development, as 
part of an HTML document, as part of something called front end 
development, which in itself is part of full stack development. So as a 
front end developer, you would have to able to target at various parts 
of a HTML document. And be able to work with each and every individual 
piece of that HTML document, each element of that document. JavaScript 
even gives us the ability to work with CSS, which CSS now gives a look 
and feel, a sort of a theme to a web page. JavaScript can work with the 
Document Object Model and HTML to effect styling on any page.</p>
<p>So with CSS and The DOM, the Document Object Model which consist of 
HTML elements, we have now the ability to completely redesign an entire 
web page. In terms of how this functionality works, think of an array. 
With the JavaScript, we can build arrays. And with an array, we can 
probably store a set of div tag in a JavaScript array.</p>
<p>This gives developers the ability to target any one of those div tags
 and change its content, change its background, even make it float off 
the page, for example. So the functionality of JavaScript can be 
leveraged to work with the Document Object Model, to work with HTML 
elements, and to work with styling. So JavaScript by itself, even with 
all of the power that it has, cannot really do anything. It has to work 
with HTML, it has to work with CSS, in order to be meaningful to an end 
user.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="1fd85de0-6af7-11e8-981b-cd9e3ae019a4">
JavaScript and ECMAScript
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Java Script and ECMA Script. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to discuss JavaScript and its relation to ECMAScript. This is a very high level overview.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: Java Script, ECMA Script, and J Script.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now ECMA, or European Computer Manufacturers Association, started out
 in or around 1961. And they are really a standards body, and they 
operate in the information and communication system space. Now, 
ECMAScript is just one of several specifications that this particular 
body has drafted. ECMAScript is a scripting language specifically or 
officially known as ECMA-262. And the current version is ES2017, which 
is also known as ES8.</p>
<p>But there have been eight editions of ECMA-262 since the body has 
started in 1961. JavaScript is a subscript of ECMAScript. But JavaScript
 was actually started by Netscape, a company that no longer exists. And 
the second version of their Navigator browser was actually the first 
browser to ever use JavaScript. JScript was Microsoft's attempt to 
implement some kind of scripting language for Internet Explorer. But the
 default is JavaScript, and now all browsers comply with that ECMAScript
 standard.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: ECMA Script Compliance, and Conformance.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And this is actually a good thing, because this ubiquitous browser 
support for ECMAScript and JavaScript. What we're going to have is the 
avoidance of proprietary software and proprietary features. But remember
 a standard is really just that. It doesn't mean that the browser 
manufacturers can't do more. And in fact, a lot of them do do more. So 
generally, though, standards compliance simply means that the 
manufacturer has promised to implement or provide support for things 
like types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax 
and semantics. As it was laid out in the ECMA-262 specification. 
According to ECMA, ECMAScript was intended to be used as a scripting 
language.</p>
<p>But recently, we noticed that it has become more of a general purpose
 language. In fact, it's now being used on the back end, on the server 
side. ECMA went on to define a scripting language as a programming 
language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate an existing
 system. So that's the key here. An existing system must exist in order 
for a scripting language to work on it. But of course, that means that 
the language should be easier. A scripting language is also meant to be 
used by both developers and the designers, making it a little bit more 
versatile. So JavaScript, then, is a general purpose language that 
conforms to ECMAScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: ECMA Script to Java Script.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can say that JavaScript is just one implementation of 
ECMAScript. There are several implementations of that ECMAScript. But 
the good news is that most browsers will implement ECMAScript in the 
same way. Meaning that we now have interoperability. So I can take a 
file that I developed on my PC and then go to a Mac and run the same 
file. And I should see the same interactions on the Mac that I did on 
the PC. In fact, a JavaScript engine is a piece of operating system 
software or interpreter that can understand and execute JavaScript code.
 JavaScript engines are present in web browsers.</p>
<p>And it's called V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and Chakra in 
Edge. A JavaScript runtime is the operating system-based environment 
which handles and executes your JavaScript code, the same JavaScript 
that we wrote. It is this runtime that makes possible those host objects
 that JavaScript needs in order to perform its functions and its tasks.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Screen titled: E S 2017 Features.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's take a look now at some of the ES8 features. So they've 
introduced something called string padding. A string is a type of object
 in JavaScript, and it has its own methods and properties. In the 
specification, they added the ability to add characters before the 
actual visible characters or after those visible characters. So there 
are two instance methods called string.prototype.padStart, 
string.prototype.padEnd.</p>
<p>They've also introduced something called 
object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors, which is a method. And it makes it 
easy for developers to copy objects. Object.values and object.entries, 
these are methods that iterate over objects and add functionality to 
what was there before. For example object.values returns an array of 
values corresponding to the existing keys in some object. They also 
introduced something called an Async Function, which instructs the 
compiler to pause whenever it sees the await keyword inside of a 
function. This is good news for developers because developers are always
 over some type of network. And so we are always waiting on something to
 give us an answer.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="22b95dc0-6af7-11e8-981b-cd9e3ae019a4">
Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Setting Up a Java Script Development Environment. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to be talking about our JavaScript 
development environment. Now JavaScript is a browser-based language, so 
we have to have a browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A desktop appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>JavaScript is also made up of text, so we have to have a text editor 
available. Then when you think about JavaScript and where it is run, it 
is run on some kind of platform. It could be a phone, tablet, or in this
 case here, it's an operating system. So at the very basic level, all we
 really need to start developing in JavaScript or using JavaScript is a 
browser, a text editor, and some kind of environment. Now of course 
there are all kinds of sophisticated IDEs, integrated development 
environments, out there that are focused on maybe a number of different 
technologies together, JavaScript is just the one of them.</p>
<p>But in this case here, in this course, we will keep it very simple. 
So if we think of our environment as a tool, then in my case it's the 
Windows operating system, and one of the tools of that system is the 
Windows File Explorer, which I've just opened up. In Windows File 
Explorer, what I have done is created a folder for my JavaScript files, 
and I have navigated to that folder.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks a file named Dev 
Environment under Quick access. Dev Environment file opens up. Following
 folders have appeared: CSS Folder. Images Folder. J S Folder. And a 
browser icon titled external, dot, html is also present.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's my first tool, the environment in which, or the platform, 
which I'm going to be using to develop JavaScript files. The second 
thing is my browser of course. Now there are lots of browsers out there 
and the more you could use when you're developing, the better it is. 
Because what happens is that they all must follow a standard, but of 
course we know that they are different manufacturers and they may 
implement that standard a little bit differently. So it's good to have 
different browsers available.</p>
<p>For this course and for most of the exercises and the demonstrations 
in this course, I will be using Chrome. I may switch to another browser 
if I feel that other browser has something that I can explain better or 
will be explained better. So in this case it is Chrome that I'm using 
and I'm going to right-click on my external file right here and open up 
Chrome. So I could just right-click on an HTML file, it will 
automatically open up to Chrome for me.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A java script web page browser opens 
up. A dialog box displays. It has following text: This page says J S 
external. and a Ok button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And right away, we see some JavaScript running. Now, this video is about the environment,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks Ok button. Following text appears on the screen: This is a paragraph.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>so we're not going to talk about the JavaScript as yet. Just know 
that this page does have some JavaScript on it. So I've opened up my 
Chrome explorer, Chrome window, and I am going to try to make my windows
 so that I can see them. So if you notice, I've doubled down on my File 
Explorer window as well as my Chrome window. So the third tool that we 
need to talk about is the text editor.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on external, dot, html. A list of options appear. He selects Edit with Notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in my case, there is a free text editor called Notepad++ on the 
Internet, and I have gone ahead and downloaded that and I have installed
 it on my machine.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Notepad++ opens up with the java codes on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, if I were to move these three windows around, then what I have</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Three screen are present on the 
desktop. 1st screen is for Java script web page. 2nd screen is for Dev 
Environment. 3rd Screen is for Java Codes in Notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>is a basic environment in which I can start developing my JavaScript 
codes. So basically what happens is that every time I make a change to 
the file that I'm working with, then that change is reflected in the 
browser. Also, most modern browsers come with developer tools. So in 
Chrome for example, if I click on Chrome to highlight it or</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the chrome screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>to ask the operating system to work with the Chrome window instead of
 the other two windows. And I hit F12 on the key board, then what's 
going to happen is the developer portion will open up.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to the java script
 browser. He clicks the F12 button on the keyboard. A developer page is 
displayed with codes and an image.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now of course, in order to see this one better, I may have to expand 
the Chrome window in this case. But as you can see, the developer 
environment is a reflection of what's going on in the final HTML 
rendition of that code. So as you can see, as I move my mouse over the 
various code lines within Chrome, the corresponding sort of highlight on
 the web page, itself, is appearing for me. So, for example, if I went 
to just the paragraph alone, then on the left side of the page, you will
 see that this is a paragraph, it's sort of highlighted for me.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code on the right side of the chrome web page, on the left screen, This is a paragraph is highlighted.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, of course, we will be talking about the developer tools much 
more in other videos, but I just wanted to give you an introduction of 
what we'll be using now. If I hit F12 again on the keyboard, that 
developer part goes away back to just the plain old HTML file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks F12 button on the keyboard,
 The codes on the chrome screen disappears. Following text appears on 
the screen: This is a paragraph.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this has been an introduction to the JavaScript environment.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="253b26a0-6af7-11e8-981b-cd9e3ae019a4">
Using a JavaScript Console
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Using a Java Script Console. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to demonstrate some of the developer tools 
in Chrome, Google Chrome. Now, most modern developers do have developer 
tools available. However, I tend to like the fact that Chrome is always 
up to date and very cutting edge. I have three windows open, File 
Explorer, that's from the operating system. I have Notepad++, and I also
 have Chrome opened up. What's happening is that we are displaying this 
particular file here, 139678a,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the chrome icon, under folder Javascript demo, named as 139678a dot html.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that's being displayed in a Chrome at the moment. And it's also opened up in Notepad++.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights screen for Java Codes in Notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it means that any change I make to my Notepad++ version of this 
139678a file will reflect in the Chrome browser once I refresh that 
page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights screen for Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So back on my Notepad++, let's make a change. I want to send something to the console window in Chrome.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 15. The 
code is: slash, slash, console, dot, log, open curved bracket, double 
quote, X is, double quote, plus X, close curved bracket, Semi-colon. He 
changed the code by removing Slash, Slash, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, it wasn't long ago that developers used console.log to debug 
their JavaScript. So I've just made a change and I'm going to save that 
change in Notepad++, back on my Chrome window I will refresh the file 
within Chrome. Notice that nothing happens, nothing happened because in 
order to see that console window within Chrome, we would have to go to 
the developer tools.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the screen of Java browser
 web page. Following number appears on the screen: 20. He refreshes the 
page. Following number appears on the screen: 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the easiest way to open up the developer tools in Chrome is to 
hit the F12 or the Function12 button on your keyboard, which I just did 
and there is my Chrome developer tools.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer page opens up with codes and an image.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if you notice, there are quite a few tabs up at the top.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On screen of Java browser web page, he highlights following tabs : Elements. Console. Sources. Network.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The ones we as JavaScript developers are interested in is the Console tab,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights console tab.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and maybe Elements, as well as Sources.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights sources tab.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now remember, the Chrome developer tools were meant for many 
developers not just JavaScript developers. So the ones that we are 
interested in, like I said, are the Elements, the Console tab, and the 
Sources tab. Let's click on Console for a second and there is the output
 that was sent from</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on councel tab, following 
text appears on the screen: x is 20. on the other side 139678a dot html,
 colon, 15 is displayed.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>my console.log, which appeared on line 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line 15 in notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If you noticed, Chrome is actually pointing to the name of the file, as well as the line that this content is coming from.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 139678a dot html, colon 15. &amp;, x is 20 in Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, in order to close your developer window, you can hit the F12 key
 on your keyboard again, or just click on this x here and it will go 
away. I want to make one more change. First of all, I'm going to comment
 that line again, and this time I'm going to</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 15. The 
code is: console, dot, log, open curved bracket, double quote, X is, 
double quote, plus X, close curved bracket, Semi-colon. He changed the 
code by adding Slash, Slash, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>introduce a deliberate error, I'm going to say x + y, now I have not declared y.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 14. The 
code is: element, dot, inner HTML, = x, semi-colon. He changed the code 
by adding +, Y, after X in the code line.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this in Notepad ++, back on my Chrome window I can refresh it and notice that the 20 went away.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again refreshes the Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That indicates to me that something happened, there's an error 
happened, but we don't see the error. In order to see that error, I 
would have to hit F12 again on the keyboard, open up the developer tools
 area, and there's the error. It even tells us the name of the file, and
 the line that the error occurred on.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks the developer tool. A screen opens up with an error on code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the developer tools is what JavaScript developers will use to find
 these kinds of errors, but there's a little bit more to it than just 
that. I'm going to close Chrome for now, go back to my File Explorer 
window, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He closes the Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>let's take a look at the b version of this file. I have 139678b file,
 I'm going to drag that over to Notepad++, and notice it's a little bit 
different.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 139678b dot html &amp;, x is 20 in Java browser web page &amp; number of codes appears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It's pointing to or connecting with an external JavaScript file,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 7. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script, s r c, =, double quote,J S, 
slash, external, dot, J s, double quote, close angular bracket, open 
angular bracket, slash, script, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it's inside a folder called JS.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights J s from the code line 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So back on my File Explorer window, if I double-click on my JS 
folder, there's my external.js file. I'm going to drag that over to my 
Notepad++, and notice that it's a very simple statement. It's just a 
very simple alert statement written in JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He opens the folder name J s, under 
folder Java script demo. Following file is present: external, dot, J s. 
He drags the file to the notepad++. A line of code appears. The code is:
 alert, open curved bracket, open quote, J S external files, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's close these two tabs now and back, went back this one as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He closes following 2 files in notepad ++: external, dot, j s. 139678b dot html</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Back in my File Explorer window, I'm going to come out of the JS 
folder by clicking on the arrow next, to the address bar, and I'm going 
to open up my b file in Chrome again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the J s folder &amp;,
 clicks on 139678b dot html. He opens up the file in chrome. Following 
text appears on the screen: This page says j s external files with an OK
 button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And immediately the JavaScript fires. So I'm going to click OK on the
 window that pops up, and we have our JavaScript, we have our HTML file 
in the browser. Now, I'm going to hit F12 on the keyboard again to open 
up our Chrome developer window. I'm going to maximize the Chrome window.
 And if you notice, the developer tools are all the way over to the 
right. Now of course, you can move this around, depending on what you're
 trying to do. In my case now, I'm going to click on the left margin of 
the developer tools window and drag it over to let's say, let's go back 
over here to about 540 pixels. Now, remember I said that one of the tabs
 that we are interested in is the Sources tab.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on the sources tab. Number of option appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I click on that tab, what I'm going to see is sort of a replicate 
of the Windows file structure. I see my root folder, I see my JavaScript
 folder, and I see my HTML file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights following options under
 sources tab: c, colon, slash, Users, slash, Admin, slash, Documents, 
JavaScript. Js. 139678b dot html.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What we're interested in as JavaScript developers is the JavaScript file itself.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He expands J s blue folder. external, dot, js folder appears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I click on that arrow next to the blue JS folder, there's my 
external JS file. If I click on that, I see the raw JavaScript itself 
within that JS file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks external, dot, j s folder, a
 line of code appears. The code is: alert, open curved bracket, open 
quote, J s external file, close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now you might think that we can just simply make changes to this. So 
for example, if I wanted to remove the word files, I might be able to do
 something like that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes files from code. The 
modified code is: alert, open curved bracket, open quote, J s external 
file, close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon. An asterisk is adds
 at the end of the file name.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Notice an asterisk appeared on the name of the file. And if I click 
Ctrl and then S, the S works another way, so you might get the feeling 
that the file was saved. But notice there's a little caution icon next 
to the name of the file. If I move my mouse over to that, it says 
Changes to this file were not saved. So how do we make these changes 
persist, how do we save these changes? Well, it's actually very easy. My
 mouse, right now, is in the white space. If I right click on this white
 space, I do have a pop up menu come up. I can go to Save as.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on the white space. A pop up menu with many options appears. He select save as option.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I choose Save as, then the system sort of sends me back over to 
the operating system, where File Explorer window takes over and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Save as, window opens up. It has a file named external, dot j s.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>asks me if I want to save this file in this particular path. If I 
click Save, then it’s going to ask me to confirm that. And I can say Yes
 at this point. And now that the original file has been saved on my 
Windows file system. So if I refresh this page, notice that the word has
 gone away, I believe it was file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the Java browser web page. Following text appears in the dialogue box: This page says J s external.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I click OK there and I minimize this window, if I go back to my
 File Explorer window, go into that .js file, drag it over to Notepad++,
 notice that the extra word is gone.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new code is: alert, open curved bracket, open quote, J S external, close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is one way of saving files on the fly. There are other ways, 
and as we move on in the course, you will see other features of Chrome 
that can actually persist without going through the Save as. But for 
now, that's a quick introduction to the developer tools in Chrome.</p></div>

Introduction to Code Spacing and Formatting
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Introduction to code Spacing and Formatting. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'd like to describe some of the best practices for 
developing JavaScript code in terms of spacing, formatting, naming of 
constants, naming of variables. And also I'd like to introduce some of 
the more recent ECMAScript standards and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, there is a screen for Java Codes in Notepad++, and a Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>specifications. On the screen I have an HTML document. The JavaScript
 that I'm using is embedded in that HTML document. So right away, we 
need to, whenever we do something like this, whenever we include 
JavaScript with HTML. We need to play nicely with all of the other HTML 
code, as well as some of the CSS code that could be in here. So notice 
that my JavaScript is already indented, and anyone looking at this will 
know exactly where the script starts and where it ends. So that brings 
me to the first specification, and it's not a ECMAScript specification, 
but on line 10, if we are using HTML 5 and older. Then it's not 
necessary to have the mime you type in within the script tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 10. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script, type, =, double quote, text, 
slash, javascript, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary, however, if you're developing for some 
older browsers, especially the Internet Explorer browsers. Then you 
would definitely want to leave that in there. Moving on to line 11, it 
is a constant that I'm declaring, and the best practice of course is to 
use uppercase characters for your declarations for constants.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: const, 
Interest, underscore, rate, =, .05, semi-colon. he highlights Interest, 
underscore, rate from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Also, if it makes sense to have two words for your constants, like in
 this case interest rate, it is better to separate them out with an 
underscore rather than putting them together.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights underscore from code line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Also, notice that of each of my statement has a semicolon at the end.
 There was a time when this was not necessary, and in some older 
browsers it still isn't necessary. However, it is a good practice, the 
best practice, to leave those in there and make sure that each 
JavaScript statement ends with a semicolon. Look at line 12, it's a very
 long line. It spans three lines actually, and the reason for doing this
 is based on yet another best practice, in that we should not have lines
 longer than 80 characters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: const, LONG, 
underscore, STRING, =, open quote, Lorem, ipsum, dolor, sit, amet, 
comma, slash. The code on line 13 is: consectetur, adipiscing, elit, 
slash, The code on line 14 is: sed do eiusmod temper incididunt, 
fullstop, close quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what we need to do for long strings like this is to separate them 
out. In this case, we're using a character, or a continuation character,
 that suggests to the browser that we have a very long string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights slash from code line 12, &amp;, 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now this best practice is a little bit controversial. But what the 
best practice says is that we should actually remove those continuation 
characters. And replace them with a concatenation character, something 
like this. So it means then that on our next slide, line number 13, we 
would have to start that string again. And of course, end it like this, 
until we are complete with the entire string itself.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 11, he adds close quote,
 plus, in place of slash. And, on code line 12, he adds open quote 
before consectetur, and close quote, plus, in place of slash.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, this does not make a difference in terms of the output, but</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the file in notepad++. He 
refreshes the javascript web page. The following text is displayed: The 
value of Long, underscore, string is Lorem, ipsum, dolor, sit, amet, 
comma, consectetur, adipiscing, elit, sed do eiusmod, temper, 
incididunt.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it does make a difference in terms of following a best practice. 
Another good practice, and this has to do with ECMAScript, is to use let
 instead of var whenever we declare and initialize variables. Now, it 
was a long time that JavaScript developers used var, and you may still 
see me using it from time to time if it's something very simple that I'm
 trying to do, however, the best practice is to use let. Also take a 
look at line 17. The suggestion is that we do not do this. In other 
words, we should not be declaring multiple variables on the same line.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 17 is: let Y,=, 100,
 comma, z,=, 50, semi-colon, slash, slash, Do not do this. He highlights
 Do not do this from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The suggestion is that we move your other variables down to another line, and declare them and initialize them there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code let, z,=, 50, semi-colon, slash, slash, Do not Do this shifted to the line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this would be the better practice, rather than keeping them on one line.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes Do not Do this from the code in line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Again, in terms of ECMAScript we now have the ability in JavaScript, 
to include the variable within the statement. So something like this, 
'The value of LONG_STRING is ${LONG_STRING}'; we can actually embed the 
variable within the statement, and so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 19 is: element, dot,
 inner HTML, =, Accent, The value of Long, underscore, String, is, 
dollar sign, open curly bracket, Long, underscore, string, close curly 
bracket, accent, semi-colon. He highlights Long, underscore, string, 
from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the entire string prints out on the browser. Now in order to do this,
 we would have to use the back ticks instead of regular single quote.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights accent from the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But of course it's much more convenient doing it this way, and in 
fact, what happens is that, because we now have this ability, we could 
do something like this. We could say, in this case, it's x + 5. In other
 words, we could do arithmetic, right, within the single statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds slash, slash in front of the 
code line 19. The code on line 20 is: element, dot, inner HTML, =, 
Accent, The value of x is dollar sign, open curly bracket, x, plus 5, 
close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I were to save this and refresh it we should see something like 25, because x was 20 before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the file in notepad++. He refreshes the javascript web page. The following text is: The value of x is 25.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now there are some more best practises when it comes to the more 
complex issues within JavaScript. Things like objects, things like 
functions, and of course, I will discuss those when we get into that 
part of the language.</p></div>

Inserting JavaScript Code
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Inserting Java Script Code. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'd like to demonstrate the three methods of adding 
JavaScript to an HTML document. Remember that JavaScript interacts with 
the HTML document. In fact, it interacts with something called the 
Document Object Model, or the DOM.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, there is a screen for Java Codes in Notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And what we mean by that is that if you look at this body tag of the,
 in fact, even the body tag can be somehow affected by the script you 
write in your JavaScript. So an HTML document is made up of all these 
different tags, the head tag, the body tag, paragraph tags, etc. And 
what we see here in this example is that we are attempting to get a 
handle on one of those tags, and attempting to change the content of 
that tag or the content that is in between the tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to the line 13. 
The code is: element, dot, inner HTML, =, open quote, New Heading, 
double quote, semi-colon. he highlights New Heading in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And this is mainly what JavaScript does, and is very good at it. So 
if we look at this example, we are getting a tag, one of the tags. In 
this case, I'm calling it Element.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the line 12. The code is: 
var, element, =, document, dot, get element by ID, open curved bracket, 
double quote, old, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it's actually pointing to this, the header tag, on the page. This page is very simple, just two HTML tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 10. The 
code is open angular bracket, h 1, i d, =, double quote, old, double 
quote, close angular bracket, &amp;, open angular bracket, slash, h 1, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And once we get a hold of that element as an object,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, elements in code line 12. The element on code line 13 gets also highlighted.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we can change the inner HTML of that element. And so we can provide it with a different wording content.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, inner HTML &amp;, New Heading in code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the old wording, had we not run JavaScript, would be Old heading.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, old heading in code line 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, once the script runs within the browser, that Old heading is going to be changed to New heading.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, new heading in code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's just take a look at how or what that would produce.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He opens a folder of Java script 
demo. Following explorer files present under it: body, dot, html chrome 
icon. external, dot, html chrome icon. Head, dot, html chrome icon. 
test, dot j s file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I open this up, we see that New heading is printed and not Old heading.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on body, dot, html chrome 
icon, &amp; choose opens up. Java browser web page opens up. Following 
text appears on the screen: Hello Skillsoft. New Heading.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now just to demonstrate the difference with this particular file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line from 11 to 
14. The code on line 11 is: open angular bracket, script, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 14 is: open angular bracket, slash, script, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we were to remove the JavaScript from the body and put it into the head, then without a function, it simply will not work.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes code line from 11 to 14, and, shifted to code line 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So see, we're back to Old heading.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the Java browser web page. Following text appears on the screen: Hello Skillsoft. Old Heading.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So whenever we need to do something really quickly, we could insert 
JavaScript into the body tag, and actually call the particular element 
that we're looking at. But mainly, JavaScript is run from the head tags.
 Let's take a look at an example with JavaScript in the head tags. So 
I'm going to close these two examples that I have.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, he close two programs. 1st program is for Java Codes in Notepad++. 2nd program is for Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to go back to my File Explorer, open up my head example, edit that with Notepad.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again opens explorer file. He 
clicks on head, dot, html chrome icon, &amp; choose edit up with 
notepad++. codes in notepad++ opens up.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can see that all of the JavaScript now is run inside of the 
head tag of the html document. Now, this video is about where the script
 is placed, it's not about functionality. So this script actually will 
not work at this point in time. However, this is just an example to show
 you that JavaScript is mainly put into the head tags. And then you 
would call it somewhere within the body of your HTML document by some 
kind of function name. So to really see this example work properly, we 
would have to wrap all of this code inside of a function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code from line 8 to 14.
 Code on line 8 is, let, x equals, open quote, 5, close quote, 
semicolon. Code on line 9 is, alert, open curved bracket, type of, x 
close curved bracket, semicolon. Code on line 10 is, if, open curved 
bracket, x, triple equals, open quote, 5, close quote, close curved 
bracket, open curly bracket. Code on line 11 is, alert, open curved 
bracket, open quote, true, close quote, close curved bracket, semicolon.
 Code on line 12 is, close curly bracket, else, open curly bracket. Code
 on line 13 is, alert, open curved bracket, open quote, false, close 
quote, close curved bracket, semicolon. Code on line 14 is, close curly 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then, within one of the events of that DOM, the Document Object 
Model, within one of the events, we will then call that function. And 
you will see lots of examples of that in the future. But there's one 
other way to insert JavaScript, and that is by an external file. And 
let's take a look at an example of that. So here, I have an external 
document, HTML document. Let's drag that over into the Notepad++ and 
take a look at what that says.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again opens explorer file. He clicks on external, dot, html chrome icon, &amp; drag the file in notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if we look at it, and again, it's placed in the head tags of the html document that you're looking at.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 7. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script, s r c, =, double quote, test, 
dot, j s, double quote, type, equals, javascript, double quote, close 
angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And so what this script is doing is it's pointing to an external file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights test, dot, j s in code line 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That file is called test.js. So what the browser's going to do because the path is suggesting</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights test, dot, j s in code line 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that this file is located in the same folder where external.html is,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights test, dot, j s tab.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>if we go to that folder, we do see test.js there. I can drag that over to my Notepad++ and actually it's just an alert.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again opens explorer file. He 
clicks on test, dot, j s &amp; drag the file in notepad++. Following 
code appears in notepad++: alert, open curved bracket, open quote, J S, 
external, close quote, close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Lets put in our semicolon there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds semi-colon after close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it's just an alert. So when this document is loaded in the 
browser, it's going to run that script for us. And as you can see, it is
 running that script. So I'll say OK to that, and close that out.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code in notepad++. He 
opens external, dot, html in the Java browser web page. Following text 
appears on the screen: This page says J s external. he clicks Ok and 
close this tab.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So some general rules is that if we want to try to affect one of the 
elements of our HTML document, that it would be better to put the script
 within the body tag. When we want to have scripts run only when an 
event occur, then we should place that script within the head tags. But 
generally, though, even the scripts that are placed in the head tags can
 be placed in an external file, which is the preferred method of doing 
this.</p>
<p>By placing scripts in an external file, what we are doing is 
separating out the HTML code from the JavaScript code, just like we 
would do with a CSS file. This makes the HTML and the JavaScript and CSS
 easier to read. Also, with modern browsers, these JavaScript's files 
can be cached, so it sort of speeds up the loading process of the HTML 
document itself. There is a little bit of a disadvantage of placing 
scripts within the head tag of an HTML page in that the browser has to 
kind of slow up and process all of that JavaScript before the rest of 
the page can be loaded. So for that reason, it's a bit of a disadvantage
 when it comes to performance of your web page. So there we see the 
three different ways of inserting JavaScript. But the preferred way, of 
course, is to create an external JavaScript file and point to that 
external file from your HTML document.</p></div>

Creating Variables
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Creating Variables. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to explore the various ways to 
declare and use variables in JavaScript. On the screen I have Notepad++ 
which has been opened up to a very simple HTML file. On the right side 
there's a Chrome window that's rendered the HTML file that you're 
looking at on the left. So the file on the left, we've embedded some 
JavaScript into the body tag of that HTML document. And we are declaring
 one paragraph in which we are changing the content of that</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 9. the code 
is: open angular bracket, p, i d, =, double quote, P 1, double quote, 
close angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, p, close angular 
bracket. He highlights P 1 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>paragraph with the variables that we've declared.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 18. The code is: element, dot, innerHTML, =, x, semi-colon. He highlights, x in the code</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So from lines 12 to 15 are the various ways to declare and use variables and JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line from 12 to 
15. The code on line 12 is: x =, 5, semi-colon, slash, slash, not 
recomended. The code on line 13 is: var, y =, 3, semi-colon. The code on
 line 14 is: let z =, open quote, Zebra, close quote, semi-colon. The 
code on line 15 is: const week =, 7, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's start with line 12 where x is equal to 5 and notice I already 
have a comment that this is not recommended. By doing this in order 
words, we eliminate one of the key words like var letter const. What 
we're doing is we've created an x variable within the global window 
object of the browser. Now that means that our global object, our x or 
global variable, in this case x, can be changed without our knowledge. 
In fact, it can even be eliminated. It can be deleted. So this is not 
the recommended way of doing this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But if you look at how Chrome has rendered the file, it works fine. 
We are printing x which has the value 5, and it prints 5. However, this 
type of declaration is not recommended, it cannot be trusted. So let's 
comment that line out. We don't want to use that anymore. Line 13 is the
 correct way of doing this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds slash, slash before x in code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with line 13, we've used the keyword var is equal to y, we still 
have a global object. However, y cannot be tampered with, without our 
knowledge. So let's see how this works in this space here. So we've 
declared it within the global object, however, I'm going to wrap this 
statement, the statements on lines, well now it's on line 18 and 19. 
Wrap those two statements inside of an if block. So let's say if y is 
the same as 3 which is true in this case, I want to be able to execute 
lines 18 and 19 in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 17. The code is: if, open curved bracket, y, equivalent, 3, close curved bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's just fix this up a little bit.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds close curly bracket in the 
code on line 20. He highlights code line 18 &amp;, 19. The code in line 
18 is: var, element, =, document, dot, get element by ID, open curved 
bracket, double quote, p 1, double quote, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon. The code in line 19 is: element, dot, inner HTML, =, x, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is that if y is equal to 3, let's go ahead and print y, the value of y to the browser window.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes y in place of x in code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save these changes, I refresh the page I do get the 3 here which is fine.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code in notepad++. He opens the Java browser web page. Following number appears on the screen: 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now let's see if this y is going to be a variable outside of the if block. So console.log and let's log our y and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 21. The code is: console, dot, log, open curved bracket, y, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>see what value we get. So I'll refresh the browser screen, nothing 
happens but if I hit F12 on the keyboard I do get into the developer 
console and there's my 3. So what this proves,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code in notepad++. He 
opens the Java browser web page. Number 3 appears on the screen from the
 last refresh. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer 
console window opens up. Number 3 appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>let me just get rid of the developer tools by hitting F12 again. What
 this proves is that y is available within the scope and even within 
inner blocks. So just to take the example a little bit further, we could
 something like this where our y = 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 18. The code is: var Y, =, 4, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save that, refresh the page and now we get 4. But let's see what that developer tools show us. So y has been changed.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code in notepad++. He 
opens the Java browser web page. Number 4 appears on the screen from the
 last refresh. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer 
console window opens up.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now on line 14, thus, this is the recommended way of declaring your 
variables from this point on. Use of the let key words started with es 
six, I believe. And, it is the recommended ways so, let's try this out. 
So I'll keep my if statement here but I'm going to change the value of 
z, in this case. So let's use the let keyword again, let z = So instead 
of a zebra, let's go with lion.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes, let, z in place of var, 
&amp;, double quote, Lion, double quote in code line 18. Now the code in
 line 18 is: let, z =, double quote, Lion, double quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's print out our z.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes, z in place of y in code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we'll also print it to the console.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> he goes to the code line 22. The code
 is: console, dot, log, open curved bracket, y, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon. He writes z, in place of y.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we started in one scope, we changed it in a different scope and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>then we went back to the original scope.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> he highlights the code line from 17 to 21. He highlights the code line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's see how this works. I'll save it, refresh the screen. I do 
get lion because z has changed at this point and I am printing z.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code in notepad++. He opens the Java browser web page. Following text appears on the screen: Lion.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But let's see what printed out on the developer console. So I'm going to hit F12 on the keyboard and what we get is zebra.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer console window opens up. Following output appears on the screen: Zebra.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is a different behavior from when we had the y before. So 
that means that wherever you use the keyword let, that variable in that 
scope is maintained.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Or just say the value of that variable within the scope is 
maintained. Once we get out of that scope, the original value is printed
 out to the screen or to the log in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights Z in the code line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Line 15 is the fourth way of declaring and using variables and it is 
the recommended way for variables that you do not expect to have any 
changes during the running of the program. So in this case, we are 
attempting to say that the week has seven days. We don't expect that to 
change. So we use the const keyword, and the behavior of const is 
exactly as the behavior of let. So there are the four different ways of 
declaring and using variables. However, let's just say it's three ways 
now from this point on.</p></div>

Basic JavaScript Operators
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Basic Java Script Operators. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'd like to demonstrate the use of basic JavaScript arithmetic and assignment operators.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, there is two screen. 1st screen is for Java Codes in Notepad++. 2nd screen is for Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the screen I have a simple HTML file, the code of which is showing
 in Notepad++. On the right side of the screen there is a Chrome browser
 that has opened up the file that you see on the left. So the file on 
the left, what we have are the five basic arithmetic operations, the 
plus, minus, multiplies, divide and the modulus operator. Now they all 
operate and work exactly like any other language. So in this case we've 
got two statements, let x=y and let y=3. So equals is the assignment 
operator.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter moves the cursor around
 code line 11, &amp; 12. Code on line 11 is: let x, =, 6, semi-colon. 
Code on line 12 is: let y, =, 3, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on lines 11 and 12, what we're seeing is take the value on the 
right side of that equal operator and assign it to the variable on the 
left. From that point on, we are using various arithmetic operators and 
as you can see, I have the values that are supposed to be printed out on
 the right-hand side.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He moves the cursor around code line 
from 14 to 18. The code on line 14 is: let, sum, =, x, plus, y, 
semi-colon, slash, slash, 9. The code on line 15 is: let, sub, =, x, 
minus, y, semi-colon, slash, slash, 3. The code on line 16 is: let, mul,
 =, x, asterisk, y, semi-colon, slash, slash, 18. The code on line 17 
is: let, div, =, x, slash, y, semi-colon, slash, slash, 2. The code on 
line 18 is: let, mod, =, x, percentage, 4, semi-colon,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, 18 modulus operator is not very familiar. So let's go through 
that a bit. What the modulus operator does is it will take the value on 
the left and divide it by the value on the right. So in this case, x 
happens to be 6 on line 11. That 6 will be divided into by 4. And 
whatever that remainder is, that's what's going to get assigned to the 
mod variable on the left. So if we were to print mod, what you see is a 
2, because 4 will go into 6 one time, but leave a remainder of two which
 is what you're seeing on the screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 22 is: element, dot,
 inner HTML, =, mod, semi-colon. He highlights mod from the code. On 
Java browser web page number 2 is displayed.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now just like in regular arithmetic and in other programming 
languages, we do have some order of precedence. Let's take a look at 
line 20.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 20 is: slash, slash, let total, =, x, asterisk, y, plus, 4, slash 2, semi-colon, slash, slash, 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to uncomment line 20 and what line 20 is saying, okay,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He deletes slash, slash from the starting of the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>take the value of whatever is on the right-hand side of that equal statement,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights , 4, slash 2 from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and assign it to the variable total.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights total from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we'll just print total, just to see what happens.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He write total in place of mod in the code line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What the statement is doing is it's saying let x*y+4/2. And obviously using the rules of arithmetic, what's going to happen is</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights x, asterisk, y, plus, 4, slash 2 from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the multiplication and division is going to happen first, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights x, asterisk, y, &amp;, 4, slash 2 from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>then the result of those two operations will be added together. So, 6
 times 3 is 18, 4 divided by 2 is 2. So, 18 plus 2 is equal to 20. But 
we can, of course, change everything, change the order by, for example, 
inserting brackets between y and 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts open curved bracket before Y and, close curved bracket, after 4 in code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if we were to save this and render it, we get 21.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the file in notepad++. He refreshes the javascript web page. The following number is: 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the entire expression has changed by the insertion of these 
brackets. So the takeaway here is that JavaScript operates just like the
 arithmetic that we all grew up with. And the same as all the other 
programming languages.</p></div>

Arithmetic and Logic Operators
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Arithmetic and Logic Operators. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to take a look at the increment and 
decrement operators in JavaScript. We'll also take a second look at the 
assignment operator and I will also talk about bitwise operations in 
JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, there is two screen. 1st screen is for Java Codes in Notepad++. 2nd screen is for Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the screen, I have Notepad ++ opened up. It's showing a simple 
HTML file with some JavaScript in the middle. On the right side, the 
right window is a Chrome window and it is showing how it has rendered 
the file on the left. If we take a look at the file on the left at line 
13, we are declaring a variable called x and assigning the value of 5 to
 it. On line 14 is where we're using that increment operator.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is: +,+, X, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The increment and decrement operator will either add 1 or remove 1 
from the value or from the variable in this case. And it will only be 1.
 There will never be another number other than 1. So line 14 is saying 
add 1 to x and line 15 is showing the value of that x after the 
operation on line 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: element, dot, inner HTML, =, X, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, we will see 6 showing up for the value of x. And I can do the 
same thing with the -- operator, which is the decrement operator. If I 
show that value, it should be 4 because 5 and then the decrement 
operator will remove 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 14, the presenter 
replaces +,+ with minus, minus. He saves the codes in notepad++ file. He
 refreshes, Java browser web page. Following number appears on the 
screen: 4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now, on line 15, we're seeing a 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights X, on code line 15. The x on code line 13 &amp;, 14 also gets highlighted.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What's interesting about the decrement and increment operators are 
the placement of those operators. So, on line 15, if I were to increment
 that operator, that variable again, you would think that 5 - 1 would be
 4 + 1</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 15, He adds + +, after x.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>should give me a 5 back, showing up on the browser window. Well let's
 save that and refresh the browser window and notice that nothing 
happened, we're still showing 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file and refreshes the Java browser web page. Following number appears on the screen: 4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The explanation is very simple. What JavaScript does is that it will take the value of x before</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights X, on code line 15. The x on code line 13 &amp;, 14 also gets highlighted.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the operation in this case because the operator is after the variable.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights +, + &amp;, x on code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it will use that value of x in the JavaScript statement. So that 
statement is saying print x. So this point in time, line 15, x has the 
value of 4. So that's what we see on the screen. Now after it has 
printed x, so the statement hasn't been executed, then the operation 
will take place. So the increment operator x on the 4 in this case and 
makes it 5 again. So on line 16, if I were to do something with that x, 
now you will see the operation happening after the first operation. So, 
there are basically two operations here. The first operation is to use 
that x and in this case, that use that x means print x, so that’s what 
we see.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights X on code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then the second operation is to add 1 to that x.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights +, + on code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the assignment operator again. So, on line 16, I
 can do something like this. I can say x +=, let's go with a 2 in this 
case, and we also want to see what happened to that. So on line 17, I 
could do something like this. I can say =x, again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code on lines 16 and 17. 
The code on line 16 is, x, +=, 2, semi-colon. The code on line 17 is, 
element, dot, inner HTML, =, X, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now we will see what happened to x because what we're seeing is 
that, well, let's print it out first. Let me save it. Print it out and 
we see a 7.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file and refreshes the Java browser web page. Following number appears on the screen: 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's take a look at the sequence of what happened. We started off with a 5, took 1 away from it, so it becomes 4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 5 on code line 13. He highlights x in code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then we added 1 to it, so it became 5 again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights X + +, in code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then finally, on line 16, this assignment operator, the += 
assignment operator is saying, take the value of x, whatever it happens 
to be, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights +, = in code line 16. He highlights X in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>it happened to be 5 now because that operation took place.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights + +, in code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it's saying, okay, look at the value of x, whatever it happens to
 be. So it happens to be 5. Add then add a 2 to it, so now it becomes 7.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> he highlights, X &amp;, 2 in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then store that 7 back in the original variable.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again highlights X in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So x now has a 7 stored in it, so that's why on line 17, we're able to print that x out. So this += operator, also,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights +, = in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we also have -= operator, *= operator. So all of these assignment 
operators will perform the action that is indicated by the operator 
itself. So -= will remove 2 from x whatever it happens to be. So if we 
had a -= 2 here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces + with minus in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save it and see what the value is, it turns out to be 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file and refreshes the Java browser web page. Following number appears on the screen: 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's because on line 15, x happens to be a 5 and if we took 2 
away from it, it's now 3. So we could this type of assignment with all 
of the other operators.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 2 in code line 16. He highlights minus, = in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, even the modulus operator can be used in this way. Let's take a 
look now at bitwise operations because what happens in bitwise 
operations is that we're going to be changing the bit patterns of those 
binary numbers. Do you remember every number is taught as a binary 
number? JavaScript's bitwise operators treat their operands as a 
sequence of 32 bits, not as decimal numbers. However, JavaScript stores 
their numbers as 64 bit floating point numbers. So when JavaScript looks
 at the number 3 for example, it's going to look at the sequence of 32 
bits with the last two bits being 1 and 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 18. The code is: slash, slash, Thirty times Zero double one.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, this would represent a 3 in decimal.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights double one in code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in terms of bitwise operations, I'm just going to insert some code
 that I have from before. And what this code is saying is let x = 1 so 
that the representation of that of course is 32 bits now. I'm just using
 4 bits in this case. And a y is that number that you saw before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 19 &amp;, 20. 
The code in line 19 is: let X, =, 1, semi-colon, slash, slash, Zero Zero
 Zero 1. He highlights Zero, Zero, Zero 1 in the code line 19. The code 
in line 20 is: let Y, =, 3, semi-colon, slash, slash, Zero, Zero 11. He 
highlights Zero, Zero 11 in the code 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, bitwise ampersand is the and operator, so if we were to do 
something like this, x &amp;amp; y, let's see what that result in. The 
&amp;amp; or the and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code in line 21. The code is: x, ampersand, y, semi-colon, slash, slash.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>bitwise operator will look at the last two digits on the right hand side and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights zero 1 in code line 19 &amp;, 1 1 in code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>say okay, if there's a 1 and a 1, I'm going to leave it as a 1. 
However, everything else would be 0, so a 1 and a 0 is a 0, a 0 and a 0 
is a 0 and the other 0 and a 0 is a 0.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes zero zero zero one after slash, slash in code line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So x &amp;amp; y or x and y in terms of bitwise operation would be the number one.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He Highlights zero zero zero one after slash, slash in code line 21</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we were to use the bitwise or operator, which is the pipe 
character on the keyboard, then that treats the binary numbers 
differently.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes vertical bar in place of 
ampersand in code line 21. Now the code in line 21 is: x, vertical bar, 
Y, semi-colon, slash, slash, zero zero zero one.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So wherever there's a 1 and a 1, it'll leave a 1. But wherever else it sees a 1, it will turn that bit into a 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes one in place of zero in code line 21. Now the code is: zero zero 1 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, a 0 and a 0 will remain 0. So x or y will actually result in
 the number 3. So, we saw examples of incrementing and decrementing. We 
saw the assignment operators again, we're using plus equals, minus 
equals, multiply equals, etc. And we took a look at the bitwise 
operations in JavaScript.</p></div>

Exercise: Using JavaScript in a Web Page
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Exercise: Using Java Script, in a Web Page. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will start with an html template, then add some
 JavaScript within the body tag. Set up the innerHTML property of an 
HTML element, so that means give it an ID. Then declare and initialize 
two variables using JavaScript, one numeric, one alphabetic. Print out 
those variables in a sentence, using the HTML element from step 1.</p>
<p>Try to use a template string or a template literal. Now, you can 
pause the video, attempt the exercise, and then return to the video to 
see the file that I've created. So you were tasked with starting an html
 template and adding some JavaScript in the body. Set up the innerHTML 
property of an HTML element with an ID. Declare and initialize two 
variables, one numeric, one alphabetic. Print out those variables in one
 sentence using the HTML element from step 1. And attempt to, or try to 
use a template string and literal.</p>
<p>Let's see how I will approach this task. On the screen, I've got my 
Windows file system opened, a File Explorer. I have Chrome open, and I 
have my template in Notepad++. I'm going to minimize File Explorer and 
work with the template file that I have so far. Notice that my template 
file has the p tags or the paragraph tags already in it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 9. The 
code is: open angular bracket, p, close angular bracket, open angular 
bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So all I really need to do right now is give it an ID.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the note pad titled. The 
titled is: C, colon, \, Users, \Admin, \, Documents, \, Java Script 
Demos, \, 139681, \, 139683 dot html, dash, Notepad++. He clicks on 
139681.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I have given my paragraph tag an ID of p1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After clicking 139681 from the note 
pad titled, The code 9 in line is: open angular bracket, p, i d, =, 
double quote, p 1, double quote, close angular bracket, open angular 
bracket, slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now within my JavaScript code, I can access that HTML element 
called p1, and insert any content into it. The next thing I would need 
are my JavaScript tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He expands code line 10.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've got my scripting tags already in place here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds code in code line 11. The code is: Let, x, = 5, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now, what I want to do is start with the JavaScript itself. And 
so my first variable is an x, which I've declared and initialized with a
 5.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds code in code line 12. The code is: Let, y, = double quote, My variable, double quote,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>My second variable is, believe it or not, is string My variable. Now,
 I have two variables. In order to do something with these variables, at
 least on the browser window, I would have to access that HTML element 
that I created on line 9.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code in code line 13. 
The code is: Let, element, =, documents, dot, get element by I d, open 
curved bracket, double quote, p1 , double quote, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in that case, I'm going to have to use yet another variable, or 
declare another variable, in which I'm trying to grab or get a hold of 
the handle of that HTML element called p1. So now that I have that 
element, I could now do something like this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code in code line 14. 
The code is: Element, dot, inner HTML, =, accent, dollar sign, open 
curly bracket, y, close curly bracket, apostrophe, s, value is, dollar 
sign, open curly bracket, x, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can now use a templated string to print out the values of those two variables.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points the code line 11 &amp;, 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So y will print out My variable.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Notice I can just insert an 's right into the statement. Value is 
whatever the value of 5 is. So if we refresh our screen, well, I need to
 save it first.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the java script webpage. The following text appears on the screen: My variable's value is 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh the screen, it should say My variable's value is 5.</p></div>
