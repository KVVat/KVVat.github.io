<h1>JavaScript Front-end Development: Data, Decision Making, &amp; Arrays</h1>
<p>JavaScript has rich language features for representing data and 
controlling the flow of programs. During this course, you will start by 
considering the seven data types defined by ECMAScript. After that you 
will explore how Java Script's type conversion functions work with its 
Comparison and Logical Operators. Next, learn how to declare and use IF 
Statements. From there you will observe how to employ a conditional 
operator statement to replace an IF/ELSE statement, and how to write a 
SWITCH statement that contains CASE and BREAK statements.  Other topics 
include how to use FOR loops, WHILE loops, and DO WHILE loops; how to 
declare an array; how to insert, retrieve, and modify values. Finally, 
learn how to loop through arrays, and work with multidimensional arrays.</p>

JavaScript Data Types
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Javascript Data Types Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to discuss the seven data types 
defined by an ECMAScript and incorporated into JavaScript. On the 
screen, I have Notepad++ opened up to an HTML file. On the right side of
 that screen is a Chrome rendition of the same file on the left. So, 
let's start with the boolean types. On Line 14, I've got the boolean 
type of truth = true. I could easily have created another variable 
called notTrue and make that = false.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is let truth = true semi colon double slash boolean comma let nottrue = false</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, this is one of the simplest data type and it probably has to be 
in every programming language on Earth. The null data type is treated 
like a primitive type. It indicates there's a lack of referencing with 
the variable, so the variable exists, but it does not reference 
anything. Nulls are important when JavaScript interacts with, for 
example, APIs, and it is expecting an object to be returned, but nothing
 was returned so null would come in handy in that situation. An 
undefined data type indicates that a variable has been declared so it 
exists, but it does not yet have a value so the value has not been 
assigned as yet. Now note that undefined is not the same as null. In 
fact, if we try to compare null and undefined, we will get a False being
 returned.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on line 16. The code here is: double slash, null, triple equal to, undefined returns false.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, if I did not use the word undefined here or the data type 
undefined and my statement is let days as I mentioned here, then days 
will still be undefined by default.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on 
line 17. The code on line 17 is : let days = undefined, semicolons, 
double forward slash undefined, comma same as let days, semi colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Along with boolean types, number types and string types have been around forever, so I'm not going to really go into those.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on 
line 18 and 19. The code on line 18 is: let x = 5, semi colon, double 
slash, number. The code on line 19 is: let first name = open quote, 
axle, close quote, semi colon, double slash, string</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Just know that when you declare a number in JavaScript you're really 
declaring just about any number that exists in some of the other 
programming languages. So that number could be a float, it could be a 
double, it could be a large int, it could be a small int, even be a big 
decimal. It doesn't really matter. Remember, JavaScript was meant to be a
 language that was created to be used by just about anybody. So even 
designers can use it. So, this is very flexible in terms of non 
programmers being able to use numbers and strings like this. ECMAScript 
2015 or ES6, created a data type that is called a symbol and it's 
supposed to be unique and immutable. Meaning that once you've created a 
const or symbol then that value should not be changed during the running
 of the program. Symbols are mainly used in objects, and they're mainly 
used for establishing keys for properties. Between lines 21 and 27 we 
have the object data type and it is the only non-primitive type.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 21 is: let vehicle =
 open curly bracket. The code on line 22 is: make, colon, open quotes, 
buick, close quotes, comma, color, colon, open quote, red, close quote, 
comma, year, colon, 2019, comma. The code on line 23 is: about me, 
colon, function, open close curve bracket, open curly bracket. The code 
on line 24 is: return this, dot, make, plus, double quote double quote, 
plus. The code on line 25 is: this, dot color, plus, double quote double
 quote, plus. The code on line 26 is: this, dot, year, semi colon, close
 curly bracket. The code on line 27 is: close curly bracket, semi colon,
 double slash, object.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As you can see, the programmer is free to develop these data types, 
develop these types and pretty much make it whatever he or she wants. In
 this case, it has properties and it has a function. And it has a lot of
 flexibility, in fact, when we discuss objects I'll show you what I mean
 by flexibility. But, just to demonstrate how our object will work in 
this case I could, for example, attempt to identify or target my vehicle</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to line thirty 
The presenter modifies the code from : PL dot inner HTML = truth semi 
colons too : PL dot inner HTML = vehicle dot about me open close curve 
brackets semicolons</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and I may want to see what the aboutMe function is about. So I could 
do something like this. And that would print out, perhaps, information 
about the particular vehicle that we're looking at. So if I refresh our 
screen, I see that it is a Buick Red 2019. So, JavaScript has seven data
 types and these data types work, at this point in time, for most 
situations.</p></div>

JavaScript Type Conversion
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: JavaScript type Conversion. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'd like to explore how type conversion works 
in JavaScript. One of the goals of JavaScript, when it was created, is 
to have a mass audience appeal. So, it wasn't just meant for developers,
 they wanted designers, they wanted non-programmers to be able to use 
the language. That may explain why we have so few data types. Also, 
JavaScript is a loosely typed language, and that means we can get away 
with things like lines 14 and 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is: x, =, open quote, five, close quote, semi colon. The code on line 15 is: X ,=, five, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, this is absolutely not recommended. I'm just showing you it here
 for demonstration purposes, but look at line 14, x started off. The 
variable x started off as a string, and on line 15, it got converted 
into a number. Something like that would be impossible in a language 
like Java or C#. Now, I will also say that conversion happens in 
JavaScript just like in other languages. So, if we take a look at line 
17, line 17 is attempting to print a number onto</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code in line seventeen is: p, 1, dot, inner, HTML = x, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>a piece of technology that can only handle strings, it can only handle text.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights x in the code on line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, what has to happen when the JavaScript engine attempts to read or
 interpret line 17 is that that x, which is a number at this point in 
time. On line 17 has to be implicitly converted into a string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 5 in the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And only then can we actually see that the rendition of that x on the browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The browser shows the following text: Javascript data types conversion. 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's an example of implicit conversion. Now, I'll attempt to get
 a date object. So let's declare a variable called date and assign it to
 new Date, and what we're going to be getting in date is a date object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts an empty line 
of code between line sixteen and seventeen. The new code on line 16 is: 
let, date, =, new, date, opened and closed curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We could then let year be the date get.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts another empty 
line between lines 17 and 18. The new code on line 17 is: let, year, =, 
date, dot, get full year, opened and closed curved brackets, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, what I'm attempting to do is extract just the last four digits of
 that date, or the year of that date, and store it in year. Now, 
implicitly, that year is going to become a number because the 
date.getFullYear method will return a number to me.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies line nineteen 
from: p, 1, dot, inner, HTML, =, X, semi colons. To: p, 1, dot, inner, 
HTML, =, year, semi colons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, if I were to print year, then I should see 2018 on the screen. So
 once again, we have implicit conversion happening on line 19 because 
year is a number that was converted to a string in order to be seen on 
the browser window. But, just to demonstrate explicit conversion, let's 
create another variable called sYear to represent a year string. And we 
can say year, we could take the same value of year, and then convert 
that to a string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts an empty line 
of code between line 18 and 19. The new code on line 18 is: let, S year,
 =, year, dot, to string, opened and closed curved brackets, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, there's another way to do that, to convert numbers to string, 
but let's just use this method now. So, we are attempting to take the 
year that happens to be a number and convert it into a string and then 
print it out. So this is explicit conversion. If I refresh the browser 
screen, notice nothing happens, because the JavaScript engine does not 
have to do any work on line 20. That work was already done on line 18. 
Now, there is actually an operator that I wanted to demonstrate here as 
well. And that's the typeof operator. That's the operator that you would
 use to try to determine what type you're dealing with if you're not 
sure. So let's see, typeof, and if I were to attempt to get the 
typeof(year) at this point, let's save this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in 
line 20 from P, 1, dot, inner HTML, =, year, semi colon. To: P, 1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, type of, open curved bracket, year, closed curved 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I should see number, because year happens to be a number. However, sYear happens to be a string, so I should see.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds S before year in the code on line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>All right, so I had forgot to save it there, and if I refresh now, it
 says string. I just forgot to save my change there. So that's the way 
typeof works. Now, another conversion we can do is conversion from 
Boolean. So, if I were to attempt to convert, let's say, true.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In line 20, the presenter changes the
 code to p 1, dot, inner, HTML, = Number, open curve bracket, true, 
close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this and see what it happens to be. So, a true in 
JavaScript happens to be 1. And if you wanted to know what a false turns
 out to be, well, let's try that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes true to false in the code on line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can convert the Boolean type of false into a number, and 
that'll give us 0. Now, keep remembering that implicit conversion is 
happening. And after the Boolean gets converted into a number, that 
number gets converted into a string in order to be seen on the browser. 
So, one other thing I wanted to show you here is the parseInt function. 
And parseInt works very similarly to other languages.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In line 20, the presenter changes the
 code to p 1, dot, inner, HTML, = parse int, open curved bracket, closed
 curved bracket, semi colons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it takes a string, so at this point in time, we do have a string on line 18.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights s year in the code on line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if we were to convert that to a number using parseInt,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds s year between open and close curve brackets in the code on line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we should see 2018, like we did before. Again, implicit conversion is
 happening in the background. But the idea is that parseInt will accept a
 string and attempt to turn that string into a number. If it does not, 
If the conversion was not successful then, parseInt will return a 
not-a-number, NaN, to the caller. So, if I were to, for example, turn 
our parameter here into a string,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He puts s year in quotes in the code on line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and attempt to convert that, I should see not-a-number. So parseInt 
is available to developers, as well as parseFloat. But, the takeaway 
here is that conversion in JavaScript works exactly like other 
languages.</p></div>

JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title : JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators Your presenter for this session is : Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to look at JavaScript logical and 
comparison operators and see how they work. I'll start by saying that 
they work very similarly to other programming languages. In fact, all of
 these operators and operations are based on those truth tables. 
However, according to the ECMAScript, especially ES6, there is a little 
bit of an issue with the ampersand ampersand. But, generally though they
 work like we see on the screen. On the left side of your screen, 
there's a Notepad++, the application opened up to a very simple HTML 
file with some JavaScript in the middle. On the right side is a Chrome 
browser showing how it has rendered the HTML file on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following text appears on the chrome browser: Javascript logical, and comparison operator. True</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the JavaScript now, in the middle of the page. 
We have three variables, we're just going to concentrate on the first 
two, for the first part of this demo.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter refers to the codes 
from line 13 to 15. The code on line 13 is: let x = 5, semicolon. The 
code on line 14 is: let y = 55, semicolon. The code on line 15 is: let z
 = 4, semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And as you can see, the expression if x is less than 10 and or logical AND, y is greater than 50.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on 
line 16. The code here is: if, open curve bracket, x, less than sign, 
10, double ampersand, y, greater than sign, 50, close curve bracket, 
open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's execute line 17.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points at line seventeen. The code here is: p 1, dot, inner HTML = true , semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that the entire expression is true. I just had to print something on to the screen, or the browser window,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights true in the code on line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>in this case. So obviously, x is less than 10, and y is greater than 50, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we see that browser has printed true. In other words, it executed the
 expression on line 17. But JavaScript also gives us the ability to 
actually print the entire expression. So, if I were to copy that 
expression and put it directly into the innerHTML of my p1 tag,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter copies open curve 
bracket, x, less than sign, 10, double ampersand, y, greater than sign, 
50, close curve bracket, from the code on line 16. He then goes to the 
code on line 17 and replaces true with the copied code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I should get the same evaluation being returned as true. And the same thing works for OR.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He selects double ampersand in the code on line 17, and replaces it with double vertical bars.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, the OR operator are two pipe characters. I'll save this, refresh 
the screen, and we get true as well because at least one of these 
operands have to be true. So now that we know this entire expression is 
true. Actually let's put this back to the logical AND, and now</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He selects double vertical bars in the code on line 17, and replaces it with double ampersand.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that we know that it is true, let's see what the NOT operator is going to be.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds an exclamation mark, between equals, and open curve bracket, in the code on line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, I've put the NOT operator in front of the entire expression. I'm 
going to save those changes, refresh the screen. And the NOT simply 
turns everything to false, or to not what it was before. So if it was 
initially false, then the NOT operator in front of that would turn 
everything into true. Turn the entire expression to be true. Now, I did 
say that there was a little bit of a difference in terms of how 
JavaScript handles these operators. I mean, different from other 
languages. And I'm going to demonstrate that by changing this a little 
bit. So, let's remove some of this code here in my if statement, and 
then I'm going to replace it with an ampersand. Meaning that I'm 
evaluating the left-hand side with the right-hand side of the 
expression.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 16 was modified to, if, open curve bracket, x, double ampersand, y, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I know this entire expression is going to turn out to be true 
because I do have values in x and y. But what I want to see is what 
JavaScript will return to my browser window. So I'll simply replace the 
innerHTML with the very same expression that I have in my if statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter copies open curve 
bracket, x, double ampersand, y, close curve bracket, from the code on 
line 16. He goes to the code on line 17, and replaces exclamation mark, 
open curve bracket, x, less than sign, 10, double ampersand, y, greater 
than sign, 50, close curve bracket, with the copied code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save those changes, refresh the screen, and notice what it 
turns out to be. It turns out to be 55. So according to ECMAScript, what
 is going to happen here is that if we evaluate x AND y, meaning 
&amp;&amp; y, y will always be returned. Unless, we can coerce x into 
being false. So that means that if x was undefined up here, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes 5, in the code on line 13, to undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I attempt to print it, well, I'm going to have to change this because I do have this printing statement in an if statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter highlights x, double ampersand, and y in line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's change this to true, so it will always be true.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter replaces x, double ampersand, and y in line 16 with 'True'.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I will always print line 17. I'm going to save my changes. Now, 
I've just made x undefined. And if I refresh my screen, I do get 
undefined. So, in the case, where x or the expression or the operant on 
the left side</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter highlights x in line seventeen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>can't be coerced into being false, undefined turns out to false, then we</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights undefined in the code on line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>will get whatever value it is on the left, or the left operand, in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter highlights x in line seventeen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that turns out to be undefined. Now JavaScript like many other 
languages perform it's logical operations from left to right. This means
 that JavaScript can short circuit the OR operation. In other words, 
well let's go back to the truth table for a second. Remember, with the 
truth table, with the logical OR, if any of the operands happen to be 
true, then the entire expression is considered to be true. So that means
 then that if we worked on the first, or the left operand, and that 
operand returns true, there really is no need to perform another cycle 
of the processor to check on the right operand. We've already got a true
 to the entire expression. So let's see how that works here. If I had 
something like this, so x&lt;10, change our x back to 5.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes true to x less than sign ten in the code on line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I can say if x is less than 10, or, z++. And notice I have 
another variable here called z, and it's a four, actually, let's do, ++ 
z.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter is referring to line 
16, and the code has been changed to: if, open curve brackets, x, open 
angular bracket, 10, vertical bar, vertical bar, plus, plus, z, close 
curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, what this is going to do is, it is going to, what JavaScript 
will do is evaluate the expression on the left of the OR operator. And 
if this expression happens to be true, the z will never be incremented.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is now referring to 
line 17. The code of line 17 is : pl, dot, inner HTML, =, open curve 
bracket, x, ampersand, ampersand, y, close curve bracket, semicolons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's print out the value of our z and see what it happens to be.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes x, ampersand, ampersand, y, to z in the code on line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll save my changes, refresh the screen, and notice that z never 
changed. z remained 4, that proves that the right side of the operator 
never got executed. Now just to prove that, if I change my OR operator 
to an ampersand ampersand operator, and I saved my changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter replaces double vertical bars to double ampersand in the code on line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh our page, we see that four has been incremented meaning that 
the right operand of the operator was evaluated and our value was 
increased. Now, I've just demonstrated just a few of the operators here 
just to get the point across, but there are a lot more operators. And 
you are encouraged to check the documentation on those operators.</p></div>

If Statements
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: If Statements. Your presenter for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about the conditional statements in the JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The browser application open on the 
right displays the results of the code in the notepad++ file on the 
left. Currently, it is showing: JavaScript conditional Statements. CEO 
receives a bonus.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the conditional statement is represented by If, and we can extend
 that to If Else. And it works exactly like in other languages. What I 
have on the left hand side of your screen is an HTML document, with 
JavaScript in the middle. On the right side is the Chrome browser 
rendering the document on the left.</p>
<p>So, the document on the left has some JavaScript in the middle, and 
we're starting off with, we're allowing title, which is a variable to be
 equal to CEO. On line 14 is where the conditional statement comes into 
effect, we are saying that If that title contains the word CEO. And by 
using a === here, we are checking even for the casing of the letters. So
 it has to be upper case CEO. And only when that is true, are we going 
to execute line number 15,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is, If, open curved bracket, title, triple equals, open quote C E O close quote, semi-colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>which simply prints out that the CEO receives a bonus. And you see 
that happening on the Chrome window to the right. So just like in other 
languages, If the condition is not true, you may want to do something 
else. So in this case, If our title does not contain the word, CEO, in 
all uppercase, we may want to print a different message to the browser 
window. In this case, it's going to be a no bonus situation. Now I've 
just entered some code between line 16 and 18, I have included an Else 
clause in there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on lines 16 to 18 are: Line 
16: close curly bracket, else, open curly bracket. Line 17: p, 1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, open quote, No Bonus, period, accent, semicolon. Line 18:
 close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And my message of course, has to be different. Well, it doesn't have 
to be, but in this case it does make sense to be different. I'll save 
those changes, refresh the browser screen, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights lines 17 and 18. Then, 
he, saves the changes made earlier on notepad++ and refreshes the chrome
 browser. The text on the browser doesn't change.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>nothing happens, because title does have the value of CEO in it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is referring to line 13. The code on line 13 is: let, title, =, open quote, CEO, close quote, semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, If I were to change that title to CIO, save those changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces CEO with CIO in the code on line 13</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>so I've just made a change to line 13, changed CEO to CIO. I refresh 
the screen, and I get No bonus, because CIO does not equal title.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes on notepad++ and
 refreshes the browser. The text changes. New text on the browser is, 
Java script conditional statements, No bonus dot, period. He highlights,
 no bonus period, in the text.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it means, Or title does not equal CEO in this case, on line 14. 
Now, the thing is we may want our CEO to be able to get a bonus. And 
therefore this will not work. We will have to extend our If statement a 
little bit. Now, of course, there are several different ways to 
accomplish what I'm trying to show you here. But for the purposes of 
this demonstration, we could say that, well I could move this Else 
statement down a little bit, and where my first If statement ends, I 
could do something like Else. Else If, start a new statement, and then 
end it. And within those braces, is where I could insert the statements 
that pertain to a CIO, so I could, in fact, copy the same statement and 
enter it here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter copies the code on line
 15. the code is: pl, dot, inner HTML, =, open quote, $, open curly 
bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a bonus, close quote, 
semicolons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I can say receives a bonus as well. Now of course, like I said, we could do this much differently.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 16 has been modified
 to: close curly bracket, else if, open curly bracket. The code on line 
17 has been modified to: p, 1, inner HTML, =, open quote, $, accent, 
dollar sign, open curly bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a 
bonus, period, accent, semicolons. The code on line 18 has been modified
 to: close curly bracket, else, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But the point is to show you, that we can have multiple If statements
 like this. So now that we do have a CIO as being the title, we can say 
that If title is the same as CIO, in this case then once I save my 
changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is talking about line 
16. The line has been modified to: Close curly bracket, else if, open 
curve bracket, title, =, =, =, open quote, CIO, close quote, close curve
 bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>once I refresh my screen I do get the fact that a CIO receives a bonus.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes in notepad ++ , 
Then he refreshes the screen and the following text appears: CIO 
receives a bonus period. He highlights CIO receives a bonus period. on 
the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what this entire block of conditional statements equate to, is 
that if we have a CIO or a CEO, then these individuals receive bonuses, 
but everybody else will not get a bonus.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, No bonus period in the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The idea here is that we can take this line 16, and repeat it as many times as we wish, of course.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>You may not want to go to too many levels, and we do have a switch 
statement in Java, that will sort of encapsulate these statements a 
little bit better. But, JavaScript will not complain if you continue 
these Else If statements, as far as you wanted to go. Apart from the 
switch statement, JavaScript does have a ternary operator, which we will
 see in a subsequent video.</p></div>

The Conditional Operator
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: The Conditional Operator. Your host for this session is Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I wanted to demonstrate or show the 
conditional operator in JavaScript. This is the operator that takes 
three operands. It's also called the ternary operator. On the screen, on
 the left side, is an HTML document opened up in Notepad++ with 
JavaScript between lines 10 and 17. On the right side of the screen is a
 Chrome rendition of that file on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The web page on the right displays 
the results of the code you input on the left. Currently it is 
displaying the text: JavaScript Ternary Operator</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we look at the HTML document, and the JavaScript in particular, 
you will see that it is absolutely correct what is happening here. It is
 not interesting, but it is correct. On the right side, in Chrome, if I 
were to hit F12 on my keyboard and check the console window, no errors 
are occurring. So, the file works, but it's not interesting.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The Presenter clicks on the cross at the top-right to close the console window and open the result screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's introduce the ternary operator, and what the ternary operator 
allows us to do is sort of shorten the if else structure in JavaScript. I
 say sort of, because, depending on what you're trying to do, between, 
you know, if something is true or something is false, you might be 
wanting to print a long sentence. In that case, the ternary operator may
 not make sense for you. So, in this case here, I do have a bit of a 
long sentence, because I wanted to follow on from a previous example. 
But the idea is to get you to understand the ternary operator.</p>
<p>So perhaps you've seen the video where I explained the if else 
structure, and we were looking at the CEO and CIO in the title. So, on 
line 15, I'm saying, is the title equal to or the same as CIO? And that 
statement is true. Even though I didn't print it anywhere, that 
statement happens to be true. This is why I did not get any errors 
showing up in my Chrome developer tools window. So what we wanted to do 
is, if title is equal to or the same as CIO, then we want to print that 
this individual gets a bonus. On the other hand, if title does not equal
 or is not the same as CIO, we wanted to print no bonus on the browser 
window. The code that I just inserted on line 16 in the comments is the 
ternary operator.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in line 16 from: double forward slash. To: double forward slash, question mark, colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As you can see, it is a combination of two characters. However, there
 are three operands. What's left of the question mark, what's between 
the question mark and the colon, and then what's to the right of that 
colon. Let's explain it as we go along. Now, what I want to do is 
evaluate title. I want to make sure that that title equals or is the 
same as CIO. So it means, then, that I really should wrap that title up,
 or</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in line 16 from: double forward slash, question mark, colon. To: double forward slash.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that condition up, into some parentheses to make sure that I don't 
interfere with anything else. And I wanted the JavaScript engine to make
 sure that it evaluated that for me.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code of 
line fifteen from: title, triple=, open quote,CIO, close quote. To: open
 curved bracket, title, triple=, open quote, CIO, close quote, close 
curved quote, question mark, accent, $, open curly bracket, title, close
 curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then what I want to do is use the first character of the ternary 
operator. And whatever comes to the right of that character is the true 
part of the ternary statement. So, in other words, if we look at line 15
 again, we are saying that, if title is the same as CIO, then I want to 
print whatever title happens to be. In this case, CIO, I want to print 
CIO receives a bonus. Now, I'll get to the printing part in a second, 
let's just finish the ternary operator here. The thing is, the ternary 
operator is not complete. It's only complete when we insert the colon, 
because that handles the or part of it. So, obviously, if title does not
 contain CIO, we want to print no bonus to the browser window. So now 
this entire statement is now complete.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code of 
line fifteen from: open curved bracket, title, triple=, open quote, CIO,
 close quote, close curved bracket, question mark, accent, $, open curly
 bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, accent, 
semi colon. To: open curved bracket, title, triple=, open quote, CIO, 
close quote, close curved bracket, question mark, accent, $, open curly 
bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, accent, 
colon, accent, No Bonus, dot, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If title is not equal to CIO, we're going to print no bonus. However,
 if it is equal to CIO, then we'll print receives a bonus. The last part
 of this puzzle, then, is the printing part. So I could, if I wanted to,
 include my innerHTML statement here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds some text before the existing code in code line 15. The added text is: p l dot, inner H T M L, equals.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if I save this document and refresh the screen, you'll see that 
CIO receives a bonus, because title does happen to be CIO on line 13.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser on the 
right, and as a result, the text changes. New text on the browser is, 
Java Script ternary operator, C I O receives a bonus. Then he highlights
 the code line 13 in notepad ++., The code on line 13 is, let title, 
equals, open quote, C I O, close quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, just to make it a little bit clearer, I'm going to take my 
titles, the ternary part, down to line 16 now, so 15 and 16 is one 
statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He split the code on line 15 into two
 parts, the second part shifts to the code line 16. The new code on line
 15 is, p l dot, inner H T M L, equals. The new code on line 16 is, open
 curved bracket, title, triple=, open quote, CIO, close quote, close 
curved bracket, question mark, accent, $, open curly bracket, title, 
close curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, accent, colon, accent, No 
Bonus, dot, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If, for some reason, CIO is not CIO anymore, then the statement 
becomes false. If I save this change, so I've just made title equal to 
CFO.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changed C I O to C F O in code 
line 13. Now, the new code is, let title, equals, open quote, C F O, 
close quote, semi colon. He then saved the changes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the true part should not print. The false part of this ternary 
statement should now print. So I've saved my changes. If I refresh the 
Chrome window, I see No bonus.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the parts accent, $, 
open curly bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, 
accent, and, accent, No Bonus, dot, accent, in the code line 16. He then
 refreshes the Java Script browser. The text changes on the browser. The
 new text is, Java Script ternary operator, No bonus. Then he 
highlighted the text part, No bonus.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the thing to remember about the ternary operator is that the ternary operator first evaluates some condition.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlighted open curved bracket, title, triple=, open quote, CIO, close quote, close curved bracket, in the code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If that condition is true, then everything to the right of the 
question mark is what gets executed next. And what gets executed next is
 that a string is formed, and that string is passed over to 
p1.innerHTML. If the condition is false, then everything to the right of
 the colon is passed to the innerHTML statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter highlighted accent, $, 
open curly bracket, title, close curly bracket, receives a bonus, dot, 
accent, and, accent, No Bonus, dot, accent, in the code line 16. He also
 highlighted the code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the ternary operator works fine, and it works well. And it does 
save a little bit of space and time, depending on what you're trying to 
do, of course, when it comes to those if and if else statements.</p></div>

<h2 id="59edc8a0-6ee2-11e8-a814-671ad7cef381">
Switch Statements
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Switch Statements Your host for this session is Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to take a look at the switch 
statement in JavaScript. And you'll see that it behaves and operates 
exactly like it does in other programming languages. On the screen, we 
have Notepad++ opened up on the left side of your screen. It is showing 
an HTML file that has some JavaScript embedded between lines 10 and 
lines 33.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> To Be Continued Later.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the right side is a Chrome browser showing what that HTML file on 
the left would look like once that file has been rendered in the 
browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the browser 
open to the right side of the screen. The browser shows the results of 
the code which is written in a notepad file. Currently, the browser 
shows the following text: JavaScript Switch Statement. CFO receives a 
bonus of five point five percent.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the switch statement falls into that category of control flow 
statements. It allows the programmer to direct the flow or the execution
 of code depending on the value of some variable. If we take a look at 
line 16, that's where our switch statement starts, and it is evaluating 
something called title.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Line 16 contains the following code: switch, open curved bracket, title, close curved bracket, open curly bracket</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 15, that title happens to have the word CFO in it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Line 15 contains the following code: let, title, =, open quote, CFO, close quote, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if we take a look at line 24, we're seeing that if the case is in
 fact CFO, then we want our bonus variable to contain the value of 5.5. 
So that means that once we get to line 31, then title, of course, is 
CFO, but the bonus will be 5.5. So as you can see, depending on what our
 title happens to be, the code execution changes. So if we had a CIO 
here instead, then our code should change to 5%.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in 
line 15 from: let, title, =, open quote, CFO, close quote, semi colon. 
To: let, title, =, open quote, CIO, close quote, semi colon. He then 
refreshes the chrome browser, as a result, the text on the browser 
changes. The new text is, Java Script switch statement, CIO receives a 
bonus of 5 percent.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Notice both CIO and the bonus amount changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights CIO and 5% in the text on the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in this way, then, if we have a few different conditions that can 
take place, that can occur, then a switch statement is valuable in that 
case. I probably will not want to use it for more than maybe about seven
 different cases. Critical, though, to the switch statement is the break
 statement that you see showing up each time we have a case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights lines 19, 23 and 26 one by one. Code on each of these lines are same, the code is break, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What this break statement is doing is saying that, okay, if our title
 happens to be CIO, then we want that bonus to be 5.0 or 5%. But at the 
same time, we wanted to break out of this structure. Because what the 
case is doing is it's sort of like inserting imaginary curly braces 
between the colon and between the next case here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 5 point 0 in code line 
18. The code on line 18 is bonus equals 5 point 0, semi colon. He also 
highlights code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you can consider this case of CIO being a block. Also, notice that
 we can have several statements within this block, even though we don't 
have any curly braces. Take a look at lines 20 to 23.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on line 20 is, case, open quote,
 CEO, close quote, colon., Code on line 21 is bonus equals, 4 point 0, 
semi colon. Code on line 22 is term extended equals false, semi colon. 
Code on line 23 is break, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If the case is CIO, so if our title happens to be CEO, then we want 
our bonus to be 4, but we also wanted to have another variable executed 
on line 22. We wanted the termExtended to be false. Right now it is true
 once the program starts.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights 4 point 0, in code line 21. He also highlights code line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And at the same time, we're going to break out of that CEO block once we have executed 21 and 22.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code line 23. Then he highlights code lines 21 and 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, as with other languages, if we did not include our break 
statement, so, for example, if I put a comment there and our title 
happens to be CIO. Then our bonus will show up as 4, because what's 
going to happen is that the interpreter, in this case, will, first of 
all, assign 5 to bonus. But then because there's no break, that 
interpreter will simply move on to line 21 and cause bonus to have a 
value of 4 in it instead.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code in 
line 19 from: break, semi colon. To: double forward slash, break, semi 
colon Then he highlights code line 18. The code on the line 18 is, bonus
 equals, 5 point 0, semi colon. After that, he highlights, 4 point 0 in 
code line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I would have save this change and refresh the screen, we see 
that the bonus is 4, and that's not right according to our logic. So 
that break statement is extremely important.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the change in notepad ++ and
 then refreshes the browser. This changes the text on the browser. The 
new text is, Java Script switch statement, CIO receives a bonus of 4%. 
He, then highlights the digit, 4 on the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, it does play a part whenever we're trying to sort of put 
things into some kind of range. So for example, if the company has 
decided that the both CIOs and CEOs should get a bonus of 4, then again 
there's really no need for the bonus to be 5 in this case. Because 
whether title is made up of the CIO string or the CEO string, that bonus
 will be 4. So let's save this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code in 
line 18 from: bonus equals 5 point zero semi colon. To: double forward 
slash, bonus equals 5 point zero semi colon. He also modifies the code 
in line 19 from: break semi colons. To: double forward slash, break semi
 colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh the page, and you'll see that CIO receives a bonus of 4. In 
this case, this is exactly what we want. So if I were to change CIO to 
CEO, then they both get a bonus of 4%. And that might be exactly what we
 needed for the company or what the company has decided.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code in code line 15,
 from, let title, equals open quote CIO, close quote, semi colon, to, 
let title, equals open quote CEO, close quote, semi colon. He saves the 
changes in notepad ++ , and refreshes the browser. The text on the 
browser changes to, Java Script switch statement, CEO receives a bonus 
of 4%.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I'm just going to remove these comments here because I wanted to talk about the default that appears on line 27.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in 
line 19 from: double forward slash, break, semi colon. To: break, semi 
colon. And in line 18, the presenter modifies the code from: double 
forward slash, bonus equals 5 point zero semi colon. To: bonus equals 5 
point zero semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What that default is doing is it's saying that if our title is not CIO, CEO, or CFO, then let's allow that bonus to be 2.5.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 28. The code in this line is, bonus equals, 2.5, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If, let's say, we are processing salaries for a company and we have a
 lot of employees but the employee is not a CIO, CEO, or CFO, it means 
that that employee will get a bonus of 2.5 automatically. So our switch 
statement is extremely useful whenever we have several conditions and we
 wanted to perhaps execute code differently based on each condition.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="5c8f2770-6ee2-11e8-a814-671ad7cef381">
For Loops
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: For Loops. Your host for this session is Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to use JavaScript loops. And as you 
will see, looping in JavaScript is very much like all of the other 
programming languages. On the screen, I have two applications opened up,
 Notepad++ on the left and Chrome on the right.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The browser application open on the 
right displays the results of the code in the notepad++ file on the 
left. Currently, it is showing: JavaScript Loop Statements. 0 1 2 3</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The Notepad++ has been opened to a simple HTML file with JavaScript 
stuck in the middle. So between lines 10 and line 16, there is 
JavaScript, but this will change as the video continues. What the code 
shows is that we are looping through some sequence. In this case, we're 
starting out at 0 and we're going to be looping until that variable i 
happens to be just less than 4, so when i is equal to 3. In Chrome you 
see how Chrome has rendered that code. Of course, I'm using the 
paragraph tag and using the innerHTML of my p1 tag, I've labelled it p1.</p>
<p>And that's what you see on the Chrome window. So this is the for loop
 that we're all familiar with. However, since ES6, the ECMAScript 
organization has introduced a couple of new loops that we can use, the 
for of loop and the for in loop. I'm going to start with the for in 
statement, which is a statement for iterating over objects, specifically
 the innumerable properties of objects. So what I'm going to do is I'm 
going to introduce an object in this equation here. So I'm going to 
paste onto, between lines 12 and 16, I've pasted some code that makes up
 an object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts 5 lines of code
 between lines 11 and 12. he inputs the following code in them: Line 12:
 let my object equals open curve bracket. Line 13: apple colon ten 
comma. Line 14: bananas colon twenty nine comma. Line 15: pears colon 
thirteen. Line 16: close curly bracket, colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Notice that this object is simply a combination of properties. So 
what we have on the left side is a variable, and on the right side we 
have some kind of value. So this is like a key value, or a key pair, 
type of structure.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts an empty line 
of code after line 16. He inputs the following code in the empty line: 
double forward slash.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I'm going to do then is introduce the for in statement that 
will iterate over this myObject object and display the various items or 
keys and values. Actually it'll display the various keys on the Chrome 
window. So in order to do this, we can say for (i in myObject). So for 
(i in myObject), let's go ahead and print out i just like we had before.
 So line 19 will do all of the printing for us. So I'm going to save 
this change and move over to my browser on the right. Refresh that page,
 and there you see it has iterated over the keys of the myObject object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code in 
line 18 from: for open curved bracket, let I equals zero semi colon, I, 
open angular bracket, four, semi colon, plus plus I, closebr bracket, 
open curly bracket. To: for open curved bracket, I , in, my object, 
close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>This particular statement, the for in statement, works nicely with 
strings. Because a string really is just a collection of characters. 
However, you might be tempted to use it with arrays. And I would 
strongly urge you not to use it with arrays. And that's because 
JavaScript cannot guarantee that the iteration will happen exactly 
sequentially. JavaScript array keys were meant to be numerical values, 
whereas the for in was meant to be used with string type of indexes, 
like as in the case here. So for arrays, we suggest that you use the for
 of structure or the old for each that was part of ES5. So that brings 
me then to the for of loop, which was meant to address some of the 
issues in the for in loop. This loop is better at looping over data.</p>
<p>So things like arrays, strings, maps, and sets. In fact, it can 
iterate over any object that happens to have the property of iterable. 
Now, the object that I have on my screen is not iterable even though it 
appears to be so. So let's change it then, let's change it to an array. 
So let's call it myArray, and change the structure to be an array. And 
remove some of the values that we had before and change the data items 
to be strings. And if I were to do that, then I can iterate over the 
array, and of course I'm using the for of in this case, so, and we have 
declare our variable here. So let i of myArray, save those changes, 
refresh the screen, and you notice nothing happens because we are still 
iterating over the same items.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code in 
lines 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18. He inputs the following in Line: 12: 
let my array equals open square bracket. 13: open quote, apple, close 
quote, comma. 14: open quote, bananas, close quote, comma. 15: open 
quote, pears, close quote. 16: close square bracket, colon. 18: for, 
open curved bracket, let I of my array, close curved bracket, open curly
 brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And just to show you we can add another fruit here and refresh the screen, and it shows up.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts a comma after 
the code in code line 15. He inserts an empty line of code after line 
15. He inputs the following code to the empty line of code: open quote, 
plums, close quote. He then saved the changes in notepad++ and refreshed
 the chrome browser. This changed the text on the browser screen. The 
new text is, Java Script, loop statements, apple, banana, pears, plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I believe that I did mention that for each still exists. And of 
course, I could use a for each to iterate over this array. However, the 
for each does not give developers an opportunity to break out of the 
structure of the looping process. But I could, if I wanted to, do 
something like this. I can break any time I want. So if, let's say, i is
 the same as, let's say I wanted to break after pears. So P-E-A-R-S, 
let's save those changes, you'll see that plums is going to disappear 
once I refresh the screen. So I refresh the screen and it has 
disappeared. So this is a big improvement for our for of loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts an empty line 
of code bet after line 20 and inputs the following code in the empty 
line:, if, open curve bracket, I, triple =, open quote, pears, close 
quote, close curve bracket, break, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot more sophisticated ways of iterating over 
objects. But for this video I've just discussed these three items here 
and I've just reminded you of the for each loop, which still exists.</p></div>

While and Do While Loops
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title : While and Do While Loops Your Presenter For This Session : Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to demonstrate the use of while and do while
 in JavaScript. At the same time, I'll also talk about the continue 
statement, as well as labels. On the screen, I have two applications 
opened up. On the right side it's Chrome, on the left side it's 
Notepad++. It's been opened to a simple HTML file with some JavaScript 
stuck in the middle of the body tag. So between lines 10 and lines 24 we
 have JavaScript. As you can see, I am declaring an array. And between 
lines 19 and lines 23, I am using a while loop to display the values of 
that array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on line 19 is, while, open curve
 bracket, i is less than my array, dot length, close curve bracket, open
 curly bracket. Code on line 20 is, i, ++, semi colon. Code on line 21 
is, p, 1, dot, inner H T M L, + =. Code on line 22 is, double quote, 
open angle bracket, b r, close angle bracket, fruit, double quote, +, 
open curve bracket, i, close curve bracket, +, double quote, is, double 
quote, + , my array, open square bracket, i, minus, 1, close square 
bracket, semi colon. Code on line 23 is close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in Chrome, you see a rendition of the code on the left, where I'm 
going through, or I'm iterating over, that array and displaying it 
within the innerHTML of a p1 tag, the various values of that array. In 
fact, I can even switch to a do while loop, so I'm going to remove my 
statement on line 19 and put it down at line 23.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter highlights code line 
19. line 19 was modified to : do, open curly bracket and line 23 was 
modified to : Close curly bracket, while, open curve bracket, i, less 
than, my array, dot, length, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And as you can see, I'm going save this as, i'm going to refresh the 
browser screen to show the effect of that change and notice that nothing
 happens.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter saves the changes made in Notepad++ and then refreshes the chrome browser. No change is observed in the text.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The only difference between the do while loop and the while loop is 
that with the do while loop, the code between lines 20 and 22 gets 
executed regardless</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code between the lines 20 and 22 
are : code of line 20: i, plus, plus, semicolon code of line 21: p, 1, 
dot, inner HTML, plus, = code of line 22: double quote, open angular 
bracket, B R, close angular bracket, fruit, double quote, plus, open 
curve bracket, i, close curve bracket, plus, double quote, is, double 
quote, plus, my array, open square bracket, i, minus, 1, close square 
bracket, semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>of what happens to the while statement or the condition in the while 
statement. I'm just going to replace what I had before so we can start 
over. But the while loop, just save that change.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter removes the code on 
line 23 and pastes the code of line 23 on line 19. the code on line 19 
now is : while, open curve bracket, i, less than, my Array, dot, length,
 close curve bracket, open curly bracket</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh my browser screen. Notice that nothing happens, great.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes in notepad++ and refreshes the browser. No change is seen in the text on the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I want to do now is introduce that continue statement. So I'm
 going to insert some code between lines 20 and 21. So what I'm going to
 say here is that if i is the same as 2. Let's skip everything else. So 
I'm going to save that code.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 21 is : if, open curve bracket, i, =, =, =, 2, close curve bracket, continue, semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's refresh our screen and notice that i was equal to 2, that print statement is now missing.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes made in 
notepad++ and refreshes the browser. The text on the browser changes. 
The part , Fruit 2 is bananas is not there any more. New test on the 
browser is, Java Script, loop statement, open curve bracket, do, and 
while, close curve bracket, Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 3 is pears, fruit 4 
is plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, continue and break sort of do similar things, but different. Now,
 it is also possible to label any line in JavaScript. So for example, I 
can insert a label on line 19 to label the fact that I want this loop to
 have a label on it. So I could do something like this. I can say 
myLabel, and insert a colon, so the while loop is now labeled with 
myLabel. Now I can go back to my line 21, where I inserted a continue 
statement, and also say that I want to continue at the place where 
myLabel starts.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Codes lines 19 and 21 are modified. 
Now, code on line 19 is, My Label, colon, while, open curve bracket, i, 
less than, my Array, dot, length, close curve bracket, open curly 
bracket. New code on line 21 is, if, open curve bracket, i, triple 
equals, 2, close curve bracket, continue, My Label, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've just saved the changes. If I refresh my screen, notice that 
nothing happens. Because the continue statement will simply direct the 
code execution</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes in notepad++, and refreshes the browser. No change appears on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>back up to the while loop, where it continues to execute the rest of 
the loop. But where the label business comes in handy, though, is when 
we have two loops. So, for example, I could insert another loop above 
the while loop. So, for example, right above the let statement, I can 
insert a for loop. And that for loop, I can say something like let's say
 let x = 1, x &lt; 5, let's say, x++. Let's wrap up what's now going to 
become the inner while loop inside of this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts a code line below code 
line 17, the new code on line 18 is: for, open curve bracket, let, x, =,
 1, semi colon, x, less than, 5, semi colon, x, plus, plus, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket. He inserts another code line below line 24.
 The new code on line 25 is, close curly bracket. the presenter 
highlights line 20 to line 25. Code on line 20 is, My Label, colon, 
while, open curve bracket, i, less than, my Array, dot, length, close 
curve bracket, open curly bracket. Code on line 21 is, i, ++, semi 
colon. Code on line 22 is, if, open curve bracket, i, triple equals, 2, 
close curve bracket, continue, My Label, semi colon. Code on line 23 is,
 p, 1, inner H T M L, +=. Code on line 24 is, double quote, open angular
 bracket, B R, close angular bracket, fruit, double quote, plus, open 
curve bracket, i, close curve bracket, plus, double quote, is, double 
quote, plus, my array, open square bracket, i, minus, 1, close square 
bracket, semi colon. Code on line 25 is, close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Well, let's move the label, first of all, from the while loop, put it
 where the for loop is. So now my label is at the for loop, it's not at 
the while loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Lines 18 and 20 are modified. New 
code on line 18 is, My Label, colon, for, open curve bracket, let, x, =,
 1, semi colon, x, less than, 5, semi colon, x, plus, plus, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket. New code on line 20 is, while, open curve 
bracket, i, less than, my Array, dot, length, close curve bracket, open 
curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's wrap this up by shifting it over to the right a little bit, 
save those changes. Now if I refresh my screen, so now we have a while 
loop operating inside of a for loop. Let's move this over to the right a
 little bit, save that change, refresh the screen. And notice now that 
whenever i becomes 2, we simply skip the rest of the while loop in this 
case and move back over to the for loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the changes in notepad++, 
and, refreshes the browser. Text on the browser changes. The new text 
is: Java Script loop statements, open curve bracket, do and while, close
 curve bracket., Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 1 is apple, 
Fruit 1 is apple</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now to make it a little bit more interesting, let's change the condition here to i = 3, save those changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 22 was modified to :
 if, open curve bracket, i, =, =, =, 3, close curve bracket, continue, 
my label, semicolons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh it, and now you see we're sort of looping over every two lines.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter saves the changes in 
notepad++, and refreshes the browser. The text changes to, Java Script 
loop statements, open curve bracket, do and while, close curve bracket.,
 Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 2 is bananas, Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 2 is 
bananas, Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 2 is bananas, Fruit 1 is apple, Fruit 2
 is bananas</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the while loop and the do while loop works exactly as in other programming languages.</p></div>

Declaring Arrays
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Declaringarrays. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at JavaScript 
arrays, how they're created, how we can manipulate them. On the screen, I
 have Notepad++ opened up to a very short and simple HTML file with 
JavaScript between lines 10 and 17. On the right side of your screen is a
 Chrome browser that is showing you how that document on the left would 
be rendered in a typical HTML5 standard browser. So, on the left side, 
there's the JavaScript between 10 and 17. Let's take a look at that 
JavaScript. You've probably seen me use this array in other examples. 
It's a simple array that I've created, and it has four elements in it. 
And between lines 13 and 16, we are iterating over that array using a 
for loop and accessing the elements of that array. So we're already 
seeing at least one property of the array, which is the length property 
that tells you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to the code line 
13. The code is : for, open curved bracket, let, i, =, 1, semi-colon, i,
 greater than equal to, my array, dot, length, semi-colon, i, plus plus,
 close curved bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we've seen in a previous video, at least one of the methods of an
 array, which is the forEach() method. Before I go on, though, let me 
just say that there is another way of declaring arrays. So I could say, 
let stuff = new Array, and I used the new operator here, or the new 
keyword, to create an array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 12. The code is: let stuff , =, new Array, open close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, this will work, however, it is not recommended, so I'm not going to use that style of declaring arrays.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 12. After highlighting, he deletes the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, just like in other languages, we can add items to the end of an 
array, we can remove items from the end of an array. And we do this with
 push and pop. So if I wanted to probably put a fruit at the end of this
 array, I can do something like myArray.push, and I could add an item to
 the array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The 
code is: my array, dot, push, open curved bracket, open quote, mango, 
close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can save that change, and if I refresh the browser, we will see 
mango shows up at the end, and even the length property has changed.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser . Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is grapes. 
Fruit 4 is bananas. Fruit 5 is mango. He highlights the Fruit 5 is 
mango.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>To remove the last item, we simply use pop. Now, unshift and shift 
will do similar things to the front of the array. Let's talk about 
finding items in the array. I'm going to remove this line for a second.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes the code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's just leave it at the original array. Let's save it, refresh the screen. Now we just have these four items.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser . Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is grapes. 
Fruit 4 is bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So JavaScript does have the ability to find items in an array. So 
let's use the myArray.indexOf method to find where pears is located, I 
don't have pears, let's see, plums, plums is located.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The 
code is: my array, dot, index of, open curved bracket, open quote, 
plums, close quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I could do something like this, and it will tell me that plums is 
located at, let's see, 01, at the 1th position. Let me just, in order so
 I don't have to make too many changes, I'm just going to push this out 
to the console window. So we can see the effects of what this will 
return.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, console, dot, log in the 
code line 13. Now the code is: Console, dot, log, open curved bracket, 
my array, dot, index of, open curved bracket, open quote, plums, close 
quote, close curved bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I need to know where plum is located. So if I save these changes, 
refresh the browser screen, and then hit F12 to get the developer tools.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the chrome browser. Following text is now on the screen: 
Java Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is 
grapes. Fruit 4 is bananas. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a
 developer console window opens up. Number 1 appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I do see that my plums is at position 2, so let's just check grapes quickly.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, plums with grapes in code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we will see that that now changes to position number 2, there you go.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the Java browser web page. Following text appears on the 
screen: Java Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 
is grapes. Fruit 4 is bananas. He clicks, the F12 button on the 
keyboard, a developer console window opens up. Number 2 appears on the 
screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm just going to hit F12 again to remove the bottom part that shows 
the developer tools. Back on the HTML document, let's use this 
information, let's use the indexOf to get rid of something from an 
array, and yes, we can do that. So instead of sending it off to the 
console,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, console, dot, log in the code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm actually going to have to save this position somehow. So grapes, 
if we're looking for grapes and we wanted to remove grapes, I would have
 to let, let's say, pos = myArray.indexOf('grapes'). So that, pos will 
return with the position in terms of the index, so that's 012.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, console, dot, log with 
let, pos, =, in the code line 13. Now the code is: let, pos, =, my 
array, dot, index of, open curved bracket, open quote, plums, close 
quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can then use that too to remove grapes if I wanted to. So for that,
 I would say myArray.splice is the method, splice, and I'll pass it the 
index that I wanted to remove.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 14. The code is: my array, dot, splice, open curved bracket, pos, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So myArray.splice 2 in this case will remove grapes. And actually I 
have to tell it how many items I wanted to remove, so I just wanted to 
remove that one item.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, comma, 1, after pos in code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save this, refresh our screen, and now grapes is gone.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the chrome browser. Following text is now on the screen: 
Java Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is 
bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm just going to clean my code up a little bit, I'm going to 
remove the splice that I just used and remove also the myArray.indexOf 
line. So that's line 13, I'll remove that and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes, code line 13 &amp; 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>get my code back to the way it was before. Save my changes, refresh 
my browser screen, and we're back to the original set of items.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is grapes. 
Fruit 4 is bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, one more thing on this topic I'd like to talk about is the 
includes method. So JavaScript does have an includes method, however, 
includes will return a Boolean. So let's just say that we just wanted to
 find out whether bananas is part of our array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The 
code is: my array, open curved bracket, open quote, bananas, close 
quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We could do something like this, we can say, again, I'm going to push
 it to the console, console.log. And I just wanted to find out whether 
bananas is in the array, so I don't need to know the position or 
anything like that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, console, dot, log in the 
code line 13. Now the code is: Console, dot, log, open curved bracket, 
my array, open curved bracket, open quote, bananas, close quote, close 
curved bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll save my changes, I'll refresh the screen, and it looks like I have, let's see, hit F12 again to find that error.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer 
console window opens up with an error,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And myArray is not a function, okay. So let's see, myArray.includes('bananas').</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, dot, includes, after my array, in code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save that, refresh the screen, and we see we get a true being returned.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is grapes. 
Fruit 4 is bananas. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a 
developer console window opens up. Text, True, appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So includes doesn't tell you the position of bananas, it'll simply 
tell you, yes, bananas does exist in this array. I'll hit F12 again to 
get rid of that developer window, and I will remove line 13 that 
actually looked at that includes method for us.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes code line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And before I go on, I will say that there are certain built-in array 
methods in JavaScript, such as slice, join, and indexOf. These are 
methods that will actually use the length property of your array. So 
whenever you're using these types of methods, keep that in mind. Some 
other methods, like push and splice, will actually update the length of 
the property. So keep that in mind when you're developing. Now, one 
other method I'd like to introduce is the sort method, and JavaScript 
will sort our array in ascending order. So we can simply call upon that 
sort method, and it will not return, well it will return something, but 
we don't need whatever it returns. Let's just see how it works. So I've 
called the sort method on my array, and we can refresh our</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The code is: my array, dot, sort, open close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>browser screen and notice that bananas has jumped up to the second position.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the Java browser web 
page. Following text appears on the screen: Java Script Arrays. Fruit 1 
is apple. Fruit 2 is bananas. Fruit 3 is grapes. Fruit 4 is plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, in order to get it descending, that's a bit of an advanced topic
 in that we will have to pass a function to the sort method. However, a 
very easy way to do this is to call the myArray exactly after calling 
the sort method and call the reverse method on the array. So we can, but
 you would have to do this in order, call the sort first and then call 
reverse afterwards.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 14. The code is: my array, dot, reverse, open close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh our screen, and notice that it has now reversed the order.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Arrays. Fruit 1 is plums. Fruit 2 is grapes. Fruit 3 is bananas. 
Fruit 4 is apple.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we've looked at quite a few methods, and I encourage you to look 
at the documentation for even more methods and definitely use them as 
you find them useful.</p></div>

Looping Through Arrays
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Looping through arrays. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to work with JavaScript arrays and 
looping over or iterating over these arrays. On the screen, we have two 
applications open. Notepad++ is open on your left side of the screen, 
and it's opened up to an HTML file that has some JavaScript embedded 
between lines 10 and 25. On the right side of your screen is a browser 
window that's Chrome. Chrome is showing you what the code on the left 
would look like once it's rendered in the browser. Let's take a look at 
the code itself. We are grabbing that p1 tag, which is the paragraph 
tag, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code on 
line 11. The code here is: let p 1 = document dot get element by I D, 
open curve bracket, double quote, p 1 , double quote, close curve 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we're using that to insert items off the array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to the code on 
line 22. The code here is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, 
close angular bracket, fruit, double quote, + open curve bracket, i, 
close curve bracket, + double quote, is, double quote, + my array, open 
square bracket, i minus 1, close square bracket, semi colon. He 
highlights my array, open square bracket, i minus 1, close square 
bracket, in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, on the right hand side, you see the result of using that p1 tag 
to display elements. So, we have an array declared on line 12, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: let my array =, open square bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we've entered some items in that array between lines 19 and 23.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the codes from line 13 
to 16. The code on line 13 is: open quote, apple, close quote, comma. 
The code on line 14 is: open quote, bananas, close quote, comma. The 
code on line 15 is: open quote, pears, close quote, comma. The code on 
line 16 is: open quote, plums, close quote.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We are using the first method of iterating over an array. We are 
using a while loop, and you may have seen this in a previous video,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 19 is: while, open 
curve bracket, i, less than sign, my array dot length, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket. The code on line 20 is: i, ++, semi colon. 
The code on line 21 is: p1, dot inner HTML, + =. The code on line 23 is:
 close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>but obviously we're going through the array and we are accessing the index of that array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter highlights i minus 1 in the code on line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's what's grabbing each of the values and displaying it on the browser window.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the codes from line 13 
to 16, and then points to the results in the browser. The following 
result is displayed on the browser: Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is 
bananas. Fruit 3 is pears. Fruit 4 is plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we wanted to, we can use a do while loop instead of a while loop. 
So, in that case, I will just simply cut the while part of line 19 and 
replace it with the word do, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He cuts while, open curve bracket, i,
 less than sign, my array dot length, close curve bracket, from the code
 on line 19, and replaces it with do.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>insert that while part at the bottom of the do while loop. So, I'm inserting at line 23, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He pastes the code cut from line 19 
on line 23. The new code on line 23 is: close curly bracket, while, open
 curve bracket, i, less than sign, my array dot length, close curve 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>all I've done is switched from a while loop to a do while loop. Let's
 save the changes, refresh our screen and we see we get the same result.
 So, those are already two ways of iterating over an array. A third way 
will be using a for loop, so for example, I can start my for loop at 
line 19. I can say something like for, open close parenthesis. I've 
already got an i declared and initialized on line 18, so I'll just use 
that i here, i is less than. Now array object does have a property 
called length, and that will return the amount of items we have in that 
array. So I'm simply using it in my for loop to make sure that I don't 
go beyond the bounds of that array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code on 
line 19. The new code on line 19 is: for, open curve bracket, i, semi 
colon, i, less than sign, my array, dot, length, semi colon, i, ++, 
close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's remove the iteration or the incrementing that happens on line 20.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes the code from line 20. The
 code on line 21 shifts to line 20. The code on line 22 shifts to line 
21. and the code on line 23 shifts to line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We will leave everything else. Let me remove my while statement at the bottom here and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes while, open curve bracket, i, less than sign, my array dot length, close curve bracket, from the code on line 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>on line 21 I now have to, let's say I am going to remove. The indexing works a little bit differently with the for loop, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes minus 1 from the code on line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I definitely want to start my printing at line zero,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 18. The code here is: let, i, =0, semi colon. He highlights 0 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>because that's going to give me apple.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the only other thing I would need to do is this, where I am 
showing the user, which is Fruit 1. If I leave it as i, then I will get 
zero starting my loop and humans don't understand zero, they'll 
understand one.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds +1, between i, and close curve bracket, in the code on line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen and notice 
nothing happens so that's already three ways of iterating over an array.
 But JavaScript does have a for-in loop and that was introduced with 
ES6. However that is not recommended for use with arrays. For-in was 
meant to be used with properties of an object. But JavaScript does have a
 for of statement that we can use. So let's start by changing up the 
code between lines 18 and 22. So on line 18 I'm going to remove the 
declaration initialization of i.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds double forward slash, before let, in the code on line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I am still going to use that i, but I'm going to use it within the 
for loop. So I'm going to say, let i, because I need some kind of 
indexing to happen. And I'm going to remove everything else from that 
for statement. And I'm going to say let i of myArray this time.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 19. The 
new code on line 19 is: for, open curve bracket, let i of my array, 
close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And in terms of grabbing the items off that array, I can simply use 
my i from this point on. So now I no longer have any kind of counter. 
So, I'm just going to remove some of this, some of the statements that's
 being printed and remove the array itself as well as the index and 
simply use the i in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 21. The 
new code on line 21 is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, close 
angular bracket, fruit is, double quote, i, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes, refresh our screen, and now it's going to say,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> No result is displayed on the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>okay, so I missed the cancellation character there. Let's put that back in.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds + before i, in the code on line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save everything refresh your screen, and there is our array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The results display on the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, JavaScript does have a fifth way of iterating over an array, but
 it tends to be a bit of an advanced topic. It is the for each 
statement. I say it's advance but let's see if we can do a quick 
overview of it here. Basically what happens is that we are going to have
 to create a call back function, so let's create a function here. Call 
it something like myFruits, and by default it does have a few arguments 
like value, index, and arguments.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 19. The 
new code on line 19 is: function, my fruits, open curve bracket, value, 
comma, index, comma, ae r, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what we can do with our statement is, of course, use the index+1 
because our index will start at zero. I can use that as my numbering or 
sequencing for human readability and simply use value at the end to show
 the various elements of that array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 21. The 
new code on line 21 is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, close 
angular bracket, fruit is, double quote, +, open curve bracket, index, 
+1, close curve bracket, + value, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>After that, all I really need to do is tap into my array and tap into
 the function core or method core for each. And every time I call for 
each I simply have to refer back to myFruits. Let's save our changes and
 refresh the browser screen and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 
23. The code here is: my array, dot, for each, open curve bracket, my 
fruits, close curve bracket, semi colon. The following text displays on 
the browser screen: Fruit is 1 apple. Fruit is 2 bananas. Fruit is 3 
pears. Fruit is 4 plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>as you can see so just a little bit of a fixing needs to be done. So 
fruit, let's see, let's remove is from here, fruit number one, two, 
etc., let's concatenate a better result here. So fruit one is etc., 
let's save those changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 21. The 
new code is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, close angular 
bracket, fruit, double quote, +, open curve bracket, index +1, close 
curve bracket, +, double quote, is, double quote, + value, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the screen and we see it's we're back to fruit one as apple etc.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following result is displayed on the browser: Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is bananas. Fruit 3 is pears. Fruit 4 is plums.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So there you have about five different ways of iterating over JavaScript arrays.</p></div>

Working with Multidimensional Arrays
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Working with Multidimensional arrays. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'd like to discuss multidimensional arrays in
 JavaScript. On my screen, I have two applications opened. On the left 
side is Notepad++, it is showing a short HTML file. On the right side is
 a Chrome browser showing how that file on the left is rendered once it 
opens up in a browser. The HTML file on the left has some embedded 
JavaScript between lines 10 and 18. We're going to be using this script 
to create a multidimensional array. I've already got a single 
dimensional array, and you may have seen me use this example before. 
JavaScript, unlike some other languages, does not have a special 
constructor for creating a multidimensional array. Basically, what you 
have to do is create an array inside of another array. So I've got an 
array declared and initialized on line 12, and you have probably seen me
 use this array for other examples.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: let, my 
array, =, open square bracket, open quote, apple, close quote, comma, 
open quote, plums, close quote, comma, open quote, grapes, close quote, 
comma, open quote, bananas, close quote, close square bracket, semi 
colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In order for me to make myArray into a multidimensional array, all I 
really have to do is wrap the current list of items inside of a second 
pair of square brackets.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds an open square bracket before
 the open square bracket, and close square bracket after the close 
square bracket in the code on line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just that one change, if I were to save this change and 
refresh the browser screen. You see that it almost appears as though 
myArray that I declared on line 12 is composed of just one row. You can 
look at it as a row.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following result appears on the browser: Fruit 1 is apple, plums, grapes, bananas</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically what this is is a two-dimensional array with one row and
 one cell. That cell just happens to have several different items in it,
 but it's just one cell. What I would like to do is create multiple 
rows, and I'll have one item in each row. So basically what I need to do
 is wrap up each of my items within their own square brackets. And that 
would now give me a two-dimensional array with four rows. You can think 
of it as four rows,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 12. The new code here is: let, my array, =, open square bracket, 
open square bracket, open quote, apple, close quote, close square 
bracket, comma, open square bracket, open quote, plums, close quote, 
close square bracket, comma, open square bracket, open quote, grapes, 
close quote, close square bracket, comma, open square bracket, open 
quote, bananas, close quote, close square bracket, close square bracket,
 semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>so those are all the changes that I have to make. If I save those 
changes, refresh the browser screen, you'll see that we're sort of like 
back to four different rows.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following text appears on the browser: Fruit 1 is apple. Fruit 2 is plums. Fruit 3 is grapes. Fruit 4 is bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, to see this a little bit clearer, what I could do is sort of 
actually reconfigure my code or reformat the text in my code. And now we
 can clearly see that we've got a two-dimensional array here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter splits the code on line
 12 in 6 parts. The codes on line 13, 14, 15, and 16, shift to line 18, 
19, 20, and 21 respectively. The code on line 12 is: let my array = open
 square bracket. The code on line 13 is: open square bracket, open 
quote, apple, close quote, close square bracket, comma. The code on line
 14 is: open square bracket, open quote, plums, close quote, close 
square bracket, comma. The code on line 15 is: open square bracket, open
 quote, grapes, close quote, close square bracket, comma. The code on 
line 16 is: open square bracket, open quote, bananas, close quote, close
 square bracket. The code on line 17 is: close square bracket, semi 
colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>There's an outer square brackets and four inner square brackets. So 
what I've got now is a two-dimensional array with four rows, but one 
cell inside of each row. Perhaps that's what I want, perhaps it's not 
what I want, so let's go with it's not what I want. I really wanted to 
involve some more information here. So, I want to say that my apple is 
stored in my warehouse called W1, and I also want to have some kind of a
 quantity here.</p>
<p>So, I'm not sure how apples quantify, or the units that are used, but
 let's just say it's 205. And probably I wanted to make the same change 
for the rest of the items here, so I'll just copy this to make my code 
go faster. And I'll just paste it into the various other cells that I 
have and just change, let's say, this is on Warehouse 2, this is also on
 Warehouse 2, and this one is on Warehouse 3. And maybe my quantities 
are all different. So I don't have that many plums, and maybe I have 
2805 grapes, and maybe I have 501 bananas.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the codes from line 13 to
 16. The code on line 13 is: open square bracket, open quote, apple, 
close quote, comma, open quote, W 1, close quote, comma 205, close 
square bracket, comma. The code on line 14 is: open square bracket, open
 quote, plums, close quote, comma, open quote, W 2, close quote, comma 
20, close square bracket, comma. The code on line 15 is: open square 
bracket, open quote, grapes, close quote, comma, open quote, W 2, close 
quote, comma 2805, close square bracket, comma. The code on line 16 is: 
open square bracket, open quote, bananas, close quote, comma, open 
quote, W 3, close quote, comma 501, close square bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save these changes, I refresh the screen, we will see the information coming out.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following text appears on the 
browser: Fruit 1 is apple, comma, W1, comma, 205. Fruit 2 is plums, 
comma, W2, comma, 20. Fruit 3 is grapes, comma, W2, comma, 2805. Fruit 4
 is bananas, comma, W3, comma, 501</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The idea here is that I'm using a for loop to loop through the original array that I originally had.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes from line 18 
to 21. The code on line 18 is: for, open curve bracket, let, i=1, semi 
colon, i less than equal to, my array, dot length, semi colon, i ++, 
close curve bracket, open curly bracket. The code on 19 is: p1 dot inner
 HTML, +=. The code on line 20 is: double quote, open angular bracket, b
 r, close angular bracket, fruit, double quote, +, open curve bracket, 
i, close curve bracket, +, double quote, is, double quote, +, my array, 
open square bracket, i minus 1, close square bracket, semi colon. The 
code on line 21 is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And what this loop is doing is simply picking up each of the rows and
 printing them out. Now, I had initially started my initial array with 
starting at item 1 here. I'm going to change this because I wanted to do
 something different here. I'm going to start at 0 instead and I'm going
 to change my equal to just less than, because if I went to the length 
of the array, I would be out of bounds.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 18, the presenter replaces 1 with 0, and less than equal to sign with less than sign.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What I want to show you now is how we can target each one of these 
individual cells. Again, I'm looking at a two-dimensional array as sort 
of like a matrix. There's rows and columns. So each one of these lines, 
so lines 13, 14, 15, and 16, represent rows in myArray. Whereas the 
first item on the left represent the first column or the first cell. The
 second item, so anything between, I'm separating out by items with a 
comma. So all of my fruits are located in some warehouse somewhere, and 
there's a quantity that's the third item to the right. So think of it as
 my cell one, or column one, contains my fruits. The second column 
contains the warehouse where they're located. And a third column would 
be the quantity on hand. That means I can do something like this. I can 
remove fruit, and instead I can target my apple, so I say myArray, and 
I'm going to have to use some square brackets here. So basically what 
I'm saying is the ith row, so that's i, but the first column, so my 
first column is 0, so that will give me apple. So myArray[i] [0] will 
give me apple.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the code on line 20. The 
new code on line 20 is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, close 
angular bracket, double quote, +, my array, open square bracket, i, 
close square bracket, open square bracket, 0, close square bracket, +, 
double quote, is, double quote, +, my array, open square bracket, i 
minus 1, close square bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's located, I'd have to remove the is. Well, let's do a continuation here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He splits the code on line 20 into 
two parts. The code on line 20 is: double quote, open angular bracket, b
 r, close angular bracket, double quote, +, my array, open square 
bracket, i, close square bracket, open square bracket, 0, close square 
bracket, +. The code on line 21 is: double quote, is, double quote, +, 
my array, open square bracket, i minus 1, close square bracket, semi 
colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So apple is located in the warehouse. Again, I'm going to use my ith 
position for the row. And my column will be 1 in this case because I'm 
trying to grab the warehouse number, and I'll also concatenate here as 
well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 21. The 
new code on line 21 is: double quote, is located in, double quote, +, my
 array, open square bracket, i, close square bracket, open square 
bracket, 1, close square bracket, +.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've got apple is located in Warehouse 2. And the quantity is, and
 here's where I'm going to use my last column, which is 2 in this case. 
So I'm going to concatenate myArray the ith position with the second 
column, which is the third column if we check from 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code in line 21. The 
code here is: double quote, and the quantity is, double quote, +, my 
array, open square bracket, i, close square bracket, open square 
bracket, 2, close square bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I save these changes, I refresh my browser screen, we will see 
that apple is located in Warehouse 1 and the quantity is 205. And that 
continues all the way down.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following result is displayed on 
the browser: apple is located in W1 and the quantity is 205. plums is 
located in W2 and the quantity is 20. grapes is located in W2 and the 
quantity is 2805. bananas is located in W3 and the quantity is 501.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>After you have created your two-dimensional array, then you can apply
 some of those methods that I spoke about for the single dimensional 
array, things like sorting and reversing. In fact, we can even do pop 
and push to the myArray element. You would, of course, probably want to 
have these items, you know, the rows match with what you had before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, for example, I could use myArray.push, and I can push, let's say,
 mangoes from Warehouse 4, and I have that many quantity. And then it 
will print out on the browser screen. JavaScript does allow for jagged 
arrays. Meaning that if I did not have a quantity, for example, for my 
plums,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes comma 20 from the code on line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I don't have to put it in. If I refresh the screen, I will get undefined, however, I do not get an error.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result for plums in browser changes to, plums is located in W2 and the quantity is undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you would have to, of course, account for this sort of jagged 
array in your looping here, but of course it is possible to have jagged 
arrays in JavaScript.</p></div>

Exercise: Working with Arrays
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Exercise: Working with Arrays. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create an empty array. Using a loop, fill 
up that array with numeric values. This could be sequential values or 
randomized values using the random function in JavaScript. Remove the 
third element once you've filled up your array. So, you're going to use 
at least nine values, I would say. Then with another loop, add up all of
 the elements in the array. And then display all those elements in the 
array along with their total in arithmetic fashion. So something like 1,
 2, 3, if you were to add all of the numbers from 1 to 9 you would get a
 total of 49. Now you can pause the video, attempt this exercise, and 
then return to the video to see how I would approach the exercise. So 
the exercise asked you to create an empty array and fill it up with some
 numbers, remove the third element of the array. Write a loop to add up 
all of the elements of the array, and then display those elements along 
with the total.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On desktop, there is two screen: 1st screen is for Java Codes in Notepad++. 2nd screen is for Java browser web page.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've got on the screen two applications opened up, Notepad++ as 
well as Chrome. On the Notepad++ application on the left, I have a very 
simple HTML file with JavaScript between lines 9 and 11. On the right 
side, Chrome will reveal what I decide to show, or what I decide to 
develop, between those script tags on the HTML document. So, the first 
thing we'll do is declare an array. And declaring an array is as simple 
as using a let statement or a var, the name of the array, =, and then 
two square brackets. So that's an empty array declared on line 12.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares, code on line 11 &amp; 
12. The code on line 11 is: slash, slash, declare, empty array. The code
 on line 12 is: let my array, =, open close square bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the next thing we had to do was use a loop and fill up that array. So, the first thing we need to do is create our loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The code is: slash, slash, add sequential numbers, to array.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to create our loop. It's a for loop, so basically I'm going to be adding up the numbers from 1 to 9.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 14 &amp; 
15. The code on line 14 is: for, open curved bracket, let X =, 1, 
semi-colon, x less than 10, semi-colon, x ++, close curved bracket, open
 curly bracket. The code on line 15 is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then once I have a loop, it means I can now use the push method of 
the array object to add these numbers from 1 to 9 into the array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a new code on line 15. 
The new code on line 15 is: my array, dot, push, open curved bracket, x,
 close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, the numbers 1 to 9 will become the elements of the array. Then 
we're supposed to remove the third element of the array. So basically, 
that would be the number 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 17. The 
code is: slash, slash, remove third element, open curved bracket, so 2 
if counting from zero, close curved bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in order to remove the third element of the array, I would use the
 splice function starting at the twoth position, so that's 0, 1, 2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 18. The 
code is: my array, dot, splice, open curved bracket, 2, comma, 1, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm saying to remove only one element. So, just the 3 should be 
removed with the statement. Then we're going to use another loop to add 
up all of the elements in the array. So that means, that we are going to
 add up numbers 1 to 9, excluding 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 19 &amp; 
20. The code on line 19 is: slash, slash, declare variable to hold sum. 
The code on line 20 is: let total =, zero, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to declare a total first to hold the total of all these 
numbers. Then I'm going to add up the elements using a for loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code from line 21 to 
24. The code on line 21 is: slash, slash, add up elements. the code on 
line 22 is: for, open curved bracket, let X =, Zero, semi-colon, x less 
than my array, dot length, semi-colon, x ++, close curved bracket, open 
curly bracket. The code on line 23 is: Total +, =, my array, open square
 bracket, X close square bracket, semi-colon. the code on line 24 is: 
close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So as you can see, I'm using my total to add each element of the array. And then finally I'm going to display all of this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code from line 25 to 
27. The code on line 25 is: slash, slash, display. The code on line 26 
is: p 1, dot, inner Html, +,=. The code on line 27 is: accent, dollar 
sign, open curly bracket, my array, dot, join, open curved bracket, open
 quote, +, close quote, close curved bracket, close curly bracket, =, 
dollar sign, open curly bracket, total, close curly bracket, accent, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to display the elements of the array, and I'm using the join method, joined together by the plus sign.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, +, from the code line 27.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then finally, I'll show the total using templated strings.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, total, from the code line 27.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can save all of these changes, refresh the browser screen. And 
there we see our array with all the numbers added up, and the total 
showing, as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the Java browser web page. Following number with text 
appears on the screen: Java Script Exercise. 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +
 9, =, 42.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div>
