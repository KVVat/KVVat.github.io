Using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
HTML5 is extremely powerful, especially when you consider the amount of 
effort and attention that's been put toward graphics. With CSS3, the 
HTML5 Canvas, and SVG, there is a powerhouse graphical engine under the 
HTML hood that can be used to create rich web applications. Scalable 
Vector Graphics is one feature that deserves some serious discussion. So
 in this video, I'll introduce you to SVG. SVG or Scalable Vector 
Graphics are new to HTML5. They use the <code>svg</code> tag right there
 and I'll go ahead and show an example. So you can do some really 
interesting things with text and graphics using <code>svg</code>. The first thing to know about <code>svg</code>
 is that they are inline, which means that you can fit them right into 
HTML code without having to evoke any CSS3 or JavaScript. They use XML 
to describe objects and the most important thing and this is the "S" 
part of Scalable Vector Graphics is they can be scaled freely without 
the loss of resolution. So if I zoom in on this, you can see that it 
really shows up nicely. As I keep going in, it doesn't matter, but it's 
not like Bitmap graphics that, sort of, degrades when you zoom in on 
them. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window. The 
file contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a 
meta tag and a title tag. The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;svgxmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"&gt;<br>&lt;text x="0" y="50" font-family="Verdana" font-size="55" fill="#0000ff"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;<br>&lt;/svg&gt;<br>&lt;svgxmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"&gt;<br>&lt;text
 x="0" y="45" font-family="Verdana" font-size="55" fill="#009900" 
transform="rotate(30,20,40)"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;<br>&lt;/svg&gt;<br>The
 presenter previews the file in Internet Explorer. The web page shows 
the text "Hello World" in two different layouts. In the first layout, 
the text is in the blue color. And in the second layout, the text is in 
the green color and is rotated by 30 degrees. While the presenter zooms 
in on the text, the quality of the text remains the same; it does not 
dither.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now, they pop right up on the page, you invoke them again using tags and
 they can be animated as well as indexed, searched, scripted, or even 
compressed. So you can do a number of different things with Scalable 
Vector Graphics and there is a nice option from using the Canvas or 
JavaScript, the traditional methods of creating graphics on your page in
 HTML5. They are vector based and again they are scalable, so vector 
based means they are based on lines and curves, rather than clots of 
dots that makes them scalable. Again, they use the XML format and it's a
 recommendation of the W3C that you use these things. They are going to 
definitely take off, they really haven't seen the light of day yet in 
terms of common usage, but the more you work with them, the more you'll 
realize the power of SVG. For instance, you can create images in SVG 
that can be edited with any text editor. You can again search and index 
them, script them, and compress them. And you can print them with very 
high quality at pretty much any resolution and they are zoomable. So 
play around a bit with Scalable Vector Graphics, learn how the tag 
works, and you'll be really impressed with the opportunities this new 
feature in HTML5 opens up for web design. <br>

Drawing Lines Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so I'll add a line here, <code>svg</code> is the tag and then let's give it an <code>id</code>. Now, we're not going to use the <code>id</code> in this example, but the reason we give an <code>id</code>
 is because we can actually do things with JavaScript and some other 
things. Now, what I want to do is create this line, so we use the <code>line</code> tag. Now, the important thing here is to remember that, we create that <code>svg</code> tag and then any <code>svg</code> that's invoked, like a <code>line</code> for instance, goes inside the opening and closing tags. So <code>line</code> and then we start creating some coordinates, so <code>x1=</code>, we'll make this <code>"50"</code> and this is in pixels, but we don't have to put the px in there. So we create <code>x1="50" y1="50"</code> and then <code>x2="300"</code> and <code>y</code><code>2="300"</code>. Now that we have done that, we can actually add a <code>style</code> to it and for this, we actually do use the standard CSS. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. The opening svg tag reads "&lt;svg id="redline"&gt;". He starts
 typing the code for creating a line as follows: <br>&lt;line x1="50" y1="50"x2="300" y2="300" style</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So we could do it here or we could put it in the <code>head</code> section as a style sheet, but I'm doing it right here, inline, so <code>style="stroke:</code> and here is where we give it a color <code>#ff0000</code>, that's red, <code>stroke-width</code> and in this case it'll be <code>2</code>,
 go ahead and finish that off. Now, because it's a line, we're not 
actually creating an opening and closing tag here. It's a self-closing 
tag. So we put that space and then the forward slash in before we close 
the right facing bracket. If I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that right now and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, there is our line, so we can start to do some really interesting things using <code>svg</code> with the <code>line</code> command to draw objects on the screen. And again, you can style them either using this <code>id</code> that we created and a style sheet and <code>head</code> section, or attach a style sheet, or you can style them inline in the <code>svg</code> tag. <br>
<em>The presenter specifies the style attribute in the code for the 
line. Therefore, the code now reads "&lt;line x1="50" y1="50"x2="300" 
y2="300" style="stroke: #ff0000; stroke-width: 2;" /&gt;". He saves the 
file and refreshes the web page to view the output. A red line rotated 
by 30 degrees is shown.</em>

Drawing Rectangles Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so go ahead and add a line here and start our <code>svg</code> tag and we'll give it an <code>id</code>
 just in case we need to reference it with the CSS. Now, there is a 
closing tag and then the actual drawing goes inside those tags, so we're
 going to create a rectangle and it looks like this. And we can even 
give it an id again, if we want to do something with it <code>"rrect"</code> for red rectangle. And now, we can give it some value, so an <code>x="0"</code> value, a <code>y="0"</code> value inside quotation marks, a <code>width</code>, let's make it bigger <code>"300"</code> and a <code>height="300"</code>. Now finally, we're going to give it a <code>fill</code> color and we'll use red like that and that looks pretty good. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. The opening svg tag reads "&lt;svg id="bigsquare"&gt;". To 
create a rectangle filled with the red color, he types the code 
"&lt;rect id="rrect" x="0" y="0" width="300" height="300" fill="#ff0000"
 /&gt;".</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now, this is a self-closing tag. You don't need an opening and closing 
tags, so we just put a forward slash and then the closing right facing 
bracket. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> our page, and there is our rectangle. Now, if you want to style this a little bit more, again we've given it an <code>id</code>, so we can create a <code>style</code> sheet up here. As a matter of fact, I'll go ahead and do that, create a <code>style</code>
 tag. And then, we're going to reference, the hash tag, so we're going 
to reference the id #rrect, red rectangle and let's create our stroke, 
so stroke, we'll create a color of black, and then <code>stroke-width</code>, and we'll make that <code>3</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 the page, so we can actually add strokes to it and modify it otherwise 
with CSS using that method. And again, we could have done this inline 
down here, but that's effectively how you draw rectangles using SVG with
 HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the 
output. A rectangle filled with the red color is shown. In the head 
section, the presenter adds the opening and closing style tags in 
separate lines of code. Then, to create a stylesheet for the rectangle, 
he types the following code:<br>#rrect<br>{<!-- --><br>stroke: #000;<br>stroke-width: 3;<br>}<br>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output. A black-colored border appears around the rectangle.</em>

<h2 id="cd3aed2c-d9c3-11e6-a5b1-0242c0a80503">
Creating Rounded Corners Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so go ahead and create our <code>svg</code> tag and our objects coincide here. So I'll create our <code>rect</code> tag, and then <code>x="0" y="0" width="300" height="300"</code>, and we'll give it a <code>fill</code> color and add some <code>style</code> to it because we want to modify the stroke here. So <code>style="stroke</code>, what we'll do is make that a black stroke and then <code>stroke-width</code> is going to be <code>10px</code>.
 Like that, close it off with a forward slash, it's a self-closing tag, 
so we don't need a closing tag, just that forward slash. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. Then, to create a rectangle filled with the magenta color and 
surrounded by a black border, he types the code "&lt;rect x="0" y="0" 
width="300" height="300" fill="#ff00ff" style="stroke: #000000; 
stroke-width: 10px;" /&gt;".</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now, if I <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, there is our square, it 
looks good, but what we want to do is round the corners here and to do 
that, you can put this in any order, but I'll go ahead and put it right 
here. We use <code>rx</code> and <code>ry</code> and I'll start with something like <code>"20"</code>, oops, <code>ry="20"</code>, go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 and you can see our corners have rounded up nicely. Now, if I increase 
that value, you can round them even more. So you can do a lot with a 
little bit, using the <code>svg</code> and that <code>rx</code> and <code>ry</code> to round the corners in rectangles and other objects in HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the 
output. A rectangle filled with the magenta color and surrounded by a 
black border is shown. To create rounded corners for the rectangle, the 
presenter types "rx="20" ry="20"" in the code for the rectangle. Then he
 saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. The 
corners of the rectangle are rounded now. Next the presenter changes the
 value of the rx and ry attributes to 50 in the code for the rectangle. 
He saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. The 
corners of the rectangle are rounded even more.</em>

Drawing Circles and Ellipses Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so I'll start with an <code>svg</code> tag. And I'll give it an <code>id</code> just in case, you want to reference it with the CSS or JavaScript, we call this <code>"circle1"</code>. Now we create the circle inside the <code>svg</code> tags, so it's <code>circle</code>. And then we can give an <code>id</code> if we want to specifically reference it like <code>"bcircle"</code> for blue circle. And then we start with our <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> values. So let's go ahead and do <code>"120"</code> and <code>cy</code>. And, of course, c for circle, little bit different than the x and y values used with lines and rectangles. And then the <code>r</code> finally. And let's give it a <code>fill</code>
 and it's supposed to be blue so 0000 is followed by two ffs, forward 
slash, and a closing bracket. Because it's a self-closing tag, we don't 
need a closing tag for this. Go ahead and <strong>Refresh</strong> that page. And there is our circle, nice and neat. Let's go ahead and take a look at ellipses. I'll create a new <code>svg</code> tag here and we'll call this <code>"ellipse1"</code>. Now there is a separate <code>ellipse</code> tag for <code>svg</code> but it still uses <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code>, so let's make this <code>"200"</code>, <code>cy="80"</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. The opening svg tag reads "&lt;svg id="circle1"&gt;". To create
 a circle filled with the blue color, he types the code "&lt;circle 
id="bcircle" cx="120" cy="120" r="100" fill="#0000ff" /&gt;". He saves 
the file and refreshes the web page to view the output. A circle filled 
with the blue color is shown. Next the presenter again adds the opening 
and closing svg tags in separate lines of code. The opening svg tag 
reads "&lt;svg id="ellipse1"&gt;". He starts typing the code for 
creating an ellipse filled with the yellow color as follows:<br>&lt;ellipse cx="200" cy="80"</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And then what we're going to do is a <code>rx</code> because we've got two different radiuses here or two different values, because ellipse is not a perfect circle, so <code>rx</code> and <code>ry</code>. And then <code>fill=</code> and for this we'll just use <code>"yellow"</code>, we don't have to put hexadecimal value in there. And again a self-closing tag. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>. And there is our ellipse. Now the thing is you've to be very, very careful with circles especially when you're drawing with <code>svg</code>,
 because the x and y coordinates are center-based, what that means is 
that here, for instance, if I'm replacing, say, a box on the screen and x
 and y value of <code>"20"</code> would be quite reasonable that would 
put that in 20 and down 20 because the coordinates for a box, or a 
rectangle, or a line are going to be from the upper left-hand corner of 
the object. With circles and ellipses it's a little bit different. I'll 
go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 and we'll see what happens is, we're actually dealing with center-based
 coordinates now so we've to be very careful when drawing these to give 
them ample room so they actually fit on the screen. I'll put that back 
to <code>"120"</code> and <code>"120"</code>. So that's the big thing 
you've to remember when drawing circles and ellipses. Other than that 
they work pretty much the same ways any other object with SVG, that is, 
you can apply styles to them, you can access them through the DOM using 
JavaScript and start to have some real fun drawing circles with HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type the code for creating the ellipse. 
The code now reads "&lt;ellipse cx="200" cy="80" rx="100" ry="50" 
fill="yellow" /&gt;". He saves the file and refreshes the web page to 
view the output. In addition to the circle, the web page shows an 
ellipse filled with the yellow color. The ellipse is overlapping the 
circle a bit. Therefore, the presenter changes the cx and cy attributes 
in the code for the circle to "20". He saves the file and refreshes the 
web page to view the changes. The circle and the ellipse separate from 
each other. Next he changes back the cx and cy attributes in the code 
for the circle to "120".</em>

Drawing Polylines Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so I'll start by creating our <code>svg</code> tag. And here is the tag for <code>polygon</code>, it's like this <code>polygon points</code>. And then you start putting in points for your polygon and so you can create multiple points. In this case, <code>"30,250,400,25,70,80"</code>. And then we'll assign a <code>fill="#ff0000"</code> to this and go ahead and put the forward slash and close it, it's a self-closing tag. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 and there is our polygon. So you can really do a lot. And the way these
 points work is their x and y values so xy, xy, xy and that will allow 
you to draw different things. Now I'll create another one, <code>polygon points=</code>
 now for this one, I'm not going to pretend that I'm going to make these
 up on the fly. I've actually created the set of coordinates here that 
I'll just <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong> back in here. And let's go ahead and give it a <code>fill</code>. It would be something like, <code>"#ff00ff"</code> just like a magenta. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. Then, to create a polygon filled with the red color, he types 
the code "&lt;polygon points="30,250,400,25,70,80" fill="#ff0000" 
/&gt;". He saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output.
 A polygon filled with the red color is shown. Next, the presenter 
starts typing the code for creating a polygon filled with the magenta 
color as follows:<br>&lt;polygon points=<br>He opens a Notepad file, 
which contains the coordinates for this polygon. He copies the 
coordinates and pastes them to the code. Therefore, the code now reads 
"&lt;polygon 
points="300,10,375,85,375,190,300,275,175,275,100,190,100,85,175,10"". 
He completes the code by specifying the fill attribute with the 
hexadecimal value of the magenta color. Therefore, the code now reads 
"&lt;polygon 
points="300,10,375,85,375,190,300,275,175,275,100,190,100,85,175,10" 
fill="#ff00ff" /&gt;".</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Close that Off, <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong>, 
and there is our polygon. So you can do that really easily but to figure
 out the points can often be tricky. As you can see all these different 
points are required in order to get the shape on the screen. So I 
actually have to go and figure them out before I did this example. And 
one other thing worth mentioning...I'll go ahead and put a space there, 
this is a CSS style, its <code>fill-rule</code>. And the way <code>fill-rule</code> works is you can choose one of two things, you can have <code>nonzero</code>, or you can have <code>evenodd</code>. And this will swap the way that the <code>fill</code>
 will work if you're actually using polylines, and it only works if they
 are intersecting. So if you're intersecting, if we've lines that are 
crossing over each other, you can create a different fill effect. You 
can either have a solid fill or where the lines crossover, you can 
create this, sort of, dropout effect in and it'll just show the 
background. So you have those two choices when you're working with 
polylines and its worth playing around with. Just have some fun with it,
 may be, draw a star or something and try those different fill rules. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the 
output. In addition to the polygon filled with the red color, a polygon 
filled with the magenta color is shown. In the code for the polygon 
filled with the magenta color, he modifies the fill attribute as 
follows:<br>fill="#ff00ff; fill-rule: evenodd;"</em>

Creating SVG Text in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so I'll start with the <code>svg</code> tag and then inside the tag, we'll use the <code>text</code>. This is an <code>svg</code> tag where we can start to create some coordinates <code>x="0" y="0"</code>. And then we choose our <code>font-family</code>, in this case, I'll choose <code>"Calibri"</code>. And then <code>font-size</code>, and you'll notice they are very similar to the CSS styles, the way they are named, <code>"55"</code>. And then a <code>fill</code>, and we'll do something like this <code>"#0000ff"</code>,
 which is blue. Now this is not a self-closing tag you see when I closed
 that bracket, then a closing tag appeared and the reason for that is 
that we have to put in some text, we'll put it in here. And I'll go 
ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and there you see it popped at the top of the screens. You have to watch out for coordinates with things like <code>text</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. To display the text "Hello World!" in the blue color, he types 
the code "&lt;text x="0" y="0" font-family="Calibri" font-size="55" 
fill="#0000ff"&gt; Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;". He saves the file and 
refreshes the web page to view the output. The text "Hello World!" is 
displayed in the blue color, but it is truncating at the top of the web 
page.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
It's going to be based on the center of the text and so we actually need to add some value to the <code>y</code> there, may be, to pop it down to the screen. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> and there is our text, it's really easy to use. But you want to be careful about the coordinates.<br>And, remember, you can style that using CSS styles. So if we wanted to do something like this <code>style=font-weight</code>, I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong>,
 you see that we can actually apply those styles, we don't need to put 
them in this notation here. As a matter of fact, most of this all of 
this actually could be put into a <code>style</code> tag, or a style 
sheet could be created for the document where you can apply those styles
 as long as you have no ID applied to this <code>text</code> tag. So text is really easy to use with <code>svg</code>
 and play around with it a bit. You'll have lots of fun with it, you can
 do some really interesting things using this wonderful new feature of 
HTML5. <br>
<em>In the code for the text, the presenter changes the y attribute to 
"50". He saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. 
The text does not truncate anymore. Next he specifies the style 
attribute in the code for the text as follows:<br>style="font-weight: bold;"<br>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. The text is now shown in bold.</em>

Rotating SVG Graphics in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so I'll go ahead and create a <code>svg</code> tag. And now that I've done that let's go ahead and create some <code>text</code> first, it gives them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates and we'll use <code>"Verdana"</code> for this one. Give it a <code>font-size</code> and a <code>fill</code>. And then let's go ahead and close that tag off. And inside the tag, put our text. Great, now let's also create a <code>rect</code>. Now give it a <code>width</code> of, say, <code>"100"</code>, will work, <code>height</code> same, and a <code>fill</code>. And this is a self-closing tag so let's go ahead and put that forward slash in there and a closing bracket. <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and there are two graphics. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. Then the presenter types the following code:<br>&lt;text x="0" y="45" font-family="Verdana" font-size="55" fill="#009900"&gt;Hello world&lt;/text&gt;<br>&lt;rect x="100" y="100" width="100" height="100" fill="#ff00ff" /&gt;<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output.
 The text "Hello world" is shown in the green color. The text is 
followed by a rectangle, which is filled with the magenta color.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now what we want to do here is <code>rotate</code>, and so we're going to use the <code>transform</code> property. And it's very similar to CSS in the way that it works, except we're using '<code>=</code>' instead of '<code>:</code>'. And then inside quotation marks, <code>rotate</code>, and then the value, in this case, we'll say <code>(30)</code> degrees, and <strong>Save</strong> that and I'll do it down here as well. So again <code>transform="rotate</code>, and for this one we'll make it <code>(45)</code> degrees. So let's go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page. And you can see now we can quickly rotate things using that <code>transform</code> property. Again it's very similar in syntax to CSS, but it's little different in the way we noted it using the <code>svg</code>
 tag. And you can play around with those values to come up with all 
sorts of interesting different effects, pretty quickly and easily on any
 SVG graphic. <br>
<em>To rotate the text "Hello world" by 30 degrees, the presenter 
specifies the transform attribute in the code for the text as follows:<br>transform="rotate(30)"<br>In a similar way, he specifies the transform attribute in the code for the rectangle as follows:<br>transform="rotate(45)"<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. Both the
 text and the rectangle rotate in accordance with the specified degrees.</em>

Placing Text on a Path Using SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
I'll start by creating an <code>svg</code> tag. And then let's go ahead and create our text. So we'll use the <code>text</code> tag, give it some <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values; give it a <code>font-family</code>, so we'll say <code>"Arial"</code>; and a <code>font-size</code>, like that. Then finally we'll add a color to it. So I'm going to use the <code>style</code>, inline style sheet. And fill, a little bit different, but <code>"fill:#ff0000;"</code>, which is red. And close it off, like that. Now normally, you would go ahead and close that, and have your <code>text</code>
 tag, and put your text in there but we're going to do one other thing 
first. We're going to...actually let's go ahead and put our text in 
first, I'll go ahead and show that. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> it, and there is our text. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. Then the presenter types the following code:<br>&lt;text x="10" y="100" font-family="Arial" font-size="55" style="fill: #ff0000; "&gt;<br>Hello, great big world<br>&lt;/text&gt;<br>He saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output. The text "Hello, great big world" displays in the red color.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now what I want to do before I do that is create a path. So up here, just after the <code>svg</code> tag, I'm going to create a tag called <code>defs</code> and this allows us to define a path for the text. We go ahead and inside the <code>defs</code> tag, we use <code>path</code> and we give it an <code>id</code> in this case, I'll call this <code>"path1"</code>. And then we use <code>d</code>
 to define the path. Okay, so we go ahead and inside quotation marks, we
 start putting our values. Now what we do first is we use a command and 
this command varies depending on what you're trying to do. The <code>M</code> stands for move to. So I'm going to move the cursor or the pointer to <code>75</code>,
 and then from here start creating our path. So there are two values and
 then spaces between those values. And then I'm going to use <code>A1</code> or A, it doesn't matter if you use uppercase and lowercase; <code>A1</code>, that's for an elliptical arc, and <code>1</code> and then <code>0</code> <code>0</code> to define that path, and then <code>0</code>, <code>350</code>, and then finally <code>0</code>.
 And you have to play around with this, sort of, to get used to how this
 works. But we're just going to create that elliptical path using that 
notation. <br>
<em>After the opening svg tag, the presenter adds the opening and 
closing defs tags in separate lines of code. Then, to specify the path 
for the text, he types the code "&lt;path id="path1" d="M75,20 A1,1 0 0,
 0 350,0" /&gt;".</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now once we have created that path, go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page. We can see that nothing happens, we actually have to apply that path to the text. So after the <code>text</code> tag and before our text, I'll put in this tag, <code>textPath xlink:href</code> because now we're accessing that path. We're using <code>xlink:href</code><code>=</code> and its an ID so we use the <code>"#path1"</code>.
 Now I close that. And here I actually have to put this after the text. 
I'll actually put it right there so it goes before the closing <code>text</code> tag. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 our page, and there is our path or text order path. So it's a tad 
complicated but you'll get used to it. What you'll do is you use <code>defs</code>
 to create your path. And again go out and find out what the various 
commands are, there are number of these different commands. Again <code>M</code> stands for move to, and <code>A</code>
 is elliptical arc. But once you start to understand the syntax, you can
 assign that path and then apply it to text using this notation. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page, but nothing
 happens in the output. Therefore, he types the code 
"&lt;textPathxlink:href="#path1"&gt;&lt;/textPath&gt;" after the opening
 text tag. Then he drags the closing textPath tag and drops it before 
the closing text tag. He saves the file and refreshes the web page to 
view the changes. The text "Hello, great big world" is shown in an 
elliptical arc path.</em>

Using Transparency with SVG in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Okay, I'll start by creating our <code>svg</code> tag, and then I'm going to create a <code>circle</code> and a square. So we'll start with the circle, and we use <code>cx</code>, so circleX, the x value is <code>"120"</code>, <code>cy="120"</code>. And the radius, we'll make that, say, <code>"80"</code> and then give it a <code>fill</code>, so blue. And go ahead and close that tag. And then I'll create a <code>rect</code> with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values, <code>width="150"</code>, <code>height</code>
 the same. And let's give that a fill as well, we'll make that...and 
actually I just noticed something there, make sure we put the '<code>#</code>' in here, and one there, and then <code>"#ff00ff"</code>. Close that off, <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 our page, and there is our circle and our square. Now actually I'm 
going to, may be, move this down somewhat, let's move that down to <code>"80"</code> and a little bit more say <code>"110"</code>. Okay, that's pretty good. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing svg tags in separate lines 
of code. Then he types the following code:<br>&lt;circle cx="120" cy="120" r="80" fill="#0000ff" /&gt;<br>&lt;rect x="80" y="0" width="150" height="150" fill="#ff00ff" /&gt;<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output. A circle 
and a rectangle are shown. The circle is filled with the blue color, and
 the rectangle is filled with the magenta color. The rectangle is 
overlapping the circle. Therefore, the presenter changes the y attribute
 in the code for the rectangle to "110". He saves the file and refreshes
 the web page to view the changes. The rectangle has separated out from 
the circle a bit but is still overlapping it.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So what I want to do is show you transparency. So here we're going to use the <code>opacity</code>
 attribute and it's always a decimal value. So if we wanted to make that
 50% opaque or 50% transparent, we click and we see the color of that 
has changed. Now it isn't really appearing what happened there because 
the square is on top of the circle. But I'm going to go to the <code>rect</code> because it's on top of the circle and change the <code>opacity</code>; I'm going to make that, say, <code>"0.4"</code>. We don't really need this <code>0</code> in there but I'd like to put it in anyway. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 and there is our transparency. So it's fairly easy to use. The syntax 
is quite similar to CSS except instead of using a colon you're using an 
equal sign, and then you're putting the value inside quotation marks. 
And you could just as easily do a <code>style</code> here. So I could do this, I could do <code>style="opacity</code>,
 you'll have to change this to a colon, get rid of...or actually I'm 
going to keep that closing quotation mark, put a semicolon in there. And
 suddenly we have created an inline <code>style</code> that we could have just as easily created in the style sheet. And <strong>Refresh</strong> that page; we see it hasn't changed anything so it does work exactly the same. I'll change the value a bit to <code>0.7</code> and there you can see we have altered the <code>opacity</code> again. So you can use that to create a number of interesting effects in HTML5 using Scalable Vector Graphics. <br>
<em>In the code for the circle, the presenter specifies the opacity 
attribute as "0.5". Then he saves the file and refreshes the web page to
 view the changes. The blue color of the circle changes due to the 50 
percent opacity specified. Next, in the code for the rectangle, he 
specifies the opacity attribute as "0.4". He saves the file and 
refreshes the web page to view the changes. The magenta color of the 
rectangle lightens and the rectangle looks 40 percent transparent. The 
part of the circle that was overlapped by the rectangle is now a bit 
visible. In the code for the rectangle, the presenter adds the style 
attribute and specifies opacity in it. Therefore, the code now reads 
"&lt;rect x="80" y="0" width="150" height="150" fill="#ff00ff" 
style="opacity: 0.4;" /&gt;". He saves the file and refreshes the web 
page, but nothing changes in the output. Therefore, the presenter 
changes the value of opacity to "0.7" in the style attribute. He again 
saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the changes. The 
rectangle is less opaque now.</em>
