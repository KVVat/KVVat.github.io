Working with the HTML5 Input Attributes
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Working with the HTML5 Input Attributes. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we will demonstrate some of the basic HTML5 input attributes. On our page, we have two input boxes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The advancedInput.HTML file is open 
in the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is 
mentioned in the transcript under the heading "advancedInput.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>One says First Name, and the other says Last Name. The first one we 
will introduce is the autocomplete feature. We will put in 
autocomplete="on". This means it will remember previous input with the 
same name. Anything you previously entered for fname will be 
autocompleted as you type. We will also put in autocomplete for our Last
 Name input box. But we will switch it to off, for demonstrating the 
differences. The next attribute we have is the placeholder. When there's
 no value in the input, this is what we will show as placeholder. So we 
will make it equal to first name. And the second line, we will make it 
equal to last name. The next attribute is required. This will allow the 
browser to perform a validation in these fields before submitting the 
form. This will require the field to have a value inside. The last one 
we have is autofocus. You will autofocus on the field. Let's give this 
page a try and see how it works.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He alters the lines from, code 
starts: First Name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname""&gt;, Last Name: 
&lt;input type="text" name="lname"&gt;. Code ends to code starts: First 
Name: &lt;input type="text" name="fname" autocomplete="on" 
placeholder="first name" required autofocus&gt;, Last Name: &lt;input 
type="text" name="lname" autocomplete="off" placeholder="last name" 
required&gt;. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you see, we have two input fields. These fields currently hold no 
value inside. But we have a placeholder that says First and Last Name. 
Let's try clicking on Submit first.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the 
advancedInput.HTMLHTML file under the advancedInput folder in the 
Solution Explorer and clicks the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option.
 A web page opens that contains two text boxes, First Name and Last 
Name. It also contains the Submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It will prompt us with an error saying, Please fill out this field, 
because we set them to be required. Let's put in some value inside, and 
click on Submit. Once we have already submitted, I'm going to try typing
 in again. As you can see, it will remember our input from before. 
However, for our Last Name field, it does not remember our input from 
previous try. No matter what we do here, it will not autocomplete. These
 are some of the basic input attributes.</p></div>
</div>

Using Regular Expressions in the Pattern Attribute
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Using Regular Expressions in the Pattern Attribute. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we will demonstrate the input pattern attribute. The 
pattern attribute allows us to define,&nbsp;using regular expression, 
what kind of value of input it will accept.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The pattern.HTML file is open in the 
Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is mentioned in 
the transcript under the heading "pattern.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So here we have a Postal Code input box. We will use the attribute 
required pattern, and we will input our regular expression. So we will 
have bracket, uppercase A to uppercase Z and lowercase a to lowercase z.
 This represent an alphabetical letter and then we have \d, representing
 a numerical digit. And we will repeat this pattern three times to 
represent a Canadian postal code format. Let's take a look at how the 
page will look like.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He alters the line from, code starts:
 Postal Code: &lt;input type="text" name="postalcode" 
placeholder="postal code" required&gt;. Code ends to code starts: Postal
 Code: &lt;input type="text" name="postalcode" placeholder="postal code"
 required pattern="( [ A-Za-z ] \d){3}"&gt;. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So here we have a postal code input box. If I click Submit now, it 
will prompt us to please fill out this field. Let's type in an invalid 
postal code.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the pattern.HTML file
 under the advancedInput folder in the Solution Explorer and clicks the 
View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web page opens that contains 
the Postal Code text box and Submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It will say please match the requested format. Let's now put in a 
valid input. This should be valid in regards to our requirement and you 
will see it go through.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0d646072-a91c-11e7-b050-7a420a93a8e4">
Using the HTML5 Number Attributes
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Using the HTML5 Number Attributes. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we will demonstrate the number attribute. The number 
attribute allows us to put a validation on input of an type number. So 
here, we have an input type number, that is the age.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The number.HTML file is open in the 
Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is mentioned in 
the transcript under the heading "number.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We're going to put in max. So the maximum value we will set is 65, 
and the minimum will equal to 0. We are also going to put in the step 
attributes, which will place an incremental or decremental button beside
 the field. And for every click, it will increase or decrease by a value
 of 5. So we have step="5".</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He alters the line from, code starts:
 Age: &lt;input type="number" name="age" placeholder="Age" required&gt;.
 Code ends to code starts: Age: &lt;input type="number" name="age" 
placeholder="Age" required max="65" min="0" step="5"&gt;. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this in our browser. As you can see, we have an 
input that allows us to put in the age. The scroll bar on the side 
allows us to change the value in the increment of 5 as how we set it to 
be. It will decrease to a minimum of 0 and stop as that's our set 
minimum requirement. If we place another value, I'm going to put in 80, 
it will prompt a message saying, value must be less than or equal to 65.
 Same if we enter a negative number. It will say the value must be 
greater than or equal to 0. If we enter a value that is not in the 
increment of 5,&nbsp;it will also say, please enter a valid value.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the number.HTML file 
under the advancedInput folder in the Solution Explorer and clicks the 
View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web page opens that contains 
the Age spin box and Submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That's because we set the step equal to 5. So the number must be 
dividable by 5. So if we enter a value such as 15, it will set the 
input.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0d646074-a91c-11e7-b050-7a420a93a8e4">
Styling Input Fields Based on Input Attributes
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Styling Input Fields Based on Input Attributes. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we'll be styling the input field based on the input attributes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The errorStyle.HTML file is open in 
the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is mentioned 
in the transcript under the heading "errorStyle.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we start with our form and two input fields, the First Name and 
Last Name. Both of these fields are required. The first thing we will do
 here is we will style the field. So we're going to put in style and the
 input:required, this selects all the input field that is required. And 
we will style it with border: 2 pixels, solid and green. On the page, if
 the field box has a green border we will know it is a required field. 
Next thing I will do is input:invalid. So when the input is invalid then
 we will say border:, we'll set it to 2 pixels, solid and red. However, 
as we start the page, the two field will start as empty values, which is
 against the required attribute that we have put in. So it will start as
 invalid fields, and gain its red border. Which looks weird when the 
user first log on to the page, and then see red box all over. So what we
 have to do to remedy that is to add form.touched in front of the input.
 So right in front of the input we are putting form.touched. Then we are
 going to add a little JavaScript to add the class touched to the form 
when we submit the form. The first thing to do here is to import the 
jQuery. And next, we will say script, $(document).ready(function). And 
then when input that has type equal to submit is .click, we will put a 
function, and we will put in $('form').addClass('touched'). So what this
 basically is saying is when we click on the submit button, we want to 
add the class touched to the form. And because of the CSS on top of here
 indicate that if the input is invalid inside the form with a class name
 touched, then you will mark the border red. Let's take a look at the 
page now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;, he adds, code starts: &lt;style&gt;, 
input:required {, border: 2px solid green;, }, form.touched 
input:invalid {, border: 2px solid red;, }, &lt;/style&gt;, &lt;script 
src="HTTPs://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;,
 &lt;script&gt;, $(document).ready(function () {, $('input [="submit" ] 
').click(function () {, $('form').addClass('touched');, });, });, 
&lt;/script&gt;. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As you can see, we have two field. They are both green border, as they are both required.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the errorStyle.HTML 
file under the advancedInput folder in the Solution Explorer and clicks 
the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web page opens that 
contains two text boxes, First Name and Last Name. It also contains the 
Submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's fill in the first one. I can see my autocomplete is kicking in.
 Then I'm going to just press Submit without inputting the last name. 
And we will be prompt a message saying is required field. And the border
 of the field of Last Name has now turned red.</p></div>

Validating Textual Input Data
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Virtual Textual Input Data. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we'll demonstrate how to use JavaScript to perform 
text input validation. On our page, under form id="data_sheet",&nbsp;we 
have an input called Postal Code and a button that will submit the form.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The textValidate.HTML file is open in
 the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is mentioned 
in the transcript under the heading "textValidate.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first thing we will do here is to use jQuery to perform our task.
 So first, we find our button that has the ID submit. And we'll do 
.click, the onClick event, and pass it into an anonymous function with 
event as a parameter. So what we want to do here is you want to call 
preventDefault. This will allow the button to not submit the form. The 
next thing we need to do is to create a variable called postalcode. And 
it is in equal to the input. Which is same as the id postalcode, .val, 
which is the current value of the input field. Now, here's the 
validation part. If (postalcode), and we're going to put an exclamation 
mark in front to negate the result. If postalcode does not match, and 
we're going to put in a regular expression here. The upper arrow here 
means the starting of the string. And we will expect an alphabetical 
character that is either uppercase or lowercase, then we will expect a 
number digit. And we want this particular pattern to repeat three times,
 to represent the Canadian postal code, and then a dollar sign at the 
end of the string. If the value does not match, we will alert, The 
Postal code is in wrong format, then we will just return false. If it 
passes, we want to submit the form. So we call the form with ID 
data_sheet, and call it .submit. Let's look at this page in the browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
$(document).ready(function () {, he adds, code starts: 
$('#submit_bt').click(function (event) {, event.preventDefault();, var 
postalcode = $('#postcode').val();, if (!postalcode.match(/^( [ A-Za-z 
]\d){3}$/)) {, alert("Postal code is in wrong format");, return false;, 
}, $('#data_sheet').submit();, });. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can see the postal code field on the page, and we will type in some random text and click submit.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the textValidate.HTML
 file under the advancedInput folder in the Solution Explorer and clicks
 the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web page opens that 
contains the Postal Code text box and submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then we will receive a message indicating the Postal code is in the 
wrong format. If we go with a valid postal code format and click submit,
 you will see in the URL, it has been passed through, and the form has 
been submitted.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0d646078-a91c-11e7-b050-7a420a93a8e4">
Validating Numeric Input Data
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Validating Numeric Input Data. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we'll demonstrate how to use JavaScript to validate 
number input. So we have a number input that represents the age on the 
screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The numberValidate.HTML file is open 
in the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is 
mentioned in the transcript under the heading "numberValidate.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>All we need to do inside our jQuery script is put a dollar sign and 
find the submit button .click. So on click, we will have function with 
event parameter, and we are going to have event.preventDefault. Then 
we'll create a variable called age which is equal to age input value. 
Next, we'll perform our validation. So if isNAN age, so this is to check
 whether age is not a number. So if age is not a number, or if age is 
less than 0, or if age is greater than 65. We will say alert Age is out 
of range, and return false. If the validation passes, then we will do 
data_sheet submit. Let's take a look at the page in the browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
$(document).ready(function () {, he adds, code starts: 
$('#submit_bt').click(function (event) {, event.preventDefault();, var 
age = $('#age').val();, if (isNaN(age) || age &lt; 0 || age &gt; 65) {, 
alert("Age is out of range");, return false;, }, 
$("#data_sheet").submit();, });. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on the page, we will see the age field.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the 
numberValidate.HTML file under the advancedInput folder in the Solution 
Explorer and clicks the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web 
page opens that contains the Age spin box and submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We are able to increase or decrease through the button. If we leave 
it in the negative number, we will receive an error message saying, Age 
is out of range. If we put in the number 70, the same error message will
 appear. Only when we put in a number within range, then the form can be
 submitted.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0d648781-a91c-11e7-b050-7a420a93a8e4">
Validating Date Input Data
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Validating Date Input Data. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we'll be using the JavaScript to validate date input 
field. Looking at our page right now,&nbsp;we have a date input field in
 our form called birthdate field.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The dateValidate.HTML file is open in
 the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is mentioned 
in the transcript under the heading "dateValidate.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The input type is equal to date. We will start by selecting our 
submit button. And we will say upon click, perform function, with 
parameter event. Then event.preventDefault, And we will create a 
variable called birthdate, which is equal to our birthdate input value. 
For our validation, we need to transform this into a date object. So if 
new Date, birthdate is larger than new Date. If we do not give new Date a
 parameter, the new Date will return as the current date. So here, what 
we are basically saying is the birthdate is in the future. If that's the
 case, then alert, Birth date is out of range. And return false. When 
the validation is successful, we will say ("#data_sheet").submit. Let's 
now take a look at the page inside our browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
$(document).ready(function () {, he adds, code starts: 
$('#submit_bt').click(function (event) {, event.preventDefault();, var 
birthdate = $('#birthdate').val();, if (new Date(birthdate) &gt; new 
Date()) {, alert("Birth date is out of range");, return false;, }, 
$("#data_sheet").submit();, }). Code ends. He right-clicks the 
dateValidate.HTML file under the advancedInput folder in the Solution 
Explorer and clicks the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option. A web 
page opens that contains the Birthdate field and submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We can see that the date view has been loaded and if we pick a future
 date, Today is the August 22nd, so I'm going to pick the August 25th. 
It will say, Birth date is out of range. If we click on a date that is 
in the past, then the form can be submitted.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0d648783-a91c-11e7-b050-7a420a93a8e4">
Working with Password Validation
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Working with Password Validation. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we will demonstrate how to do a front end password 
validation. So we've all signed up accounts on websites before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The passwordValidate.HTML file is 
open in the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is 
mentioned in the transcript under the heading "passwordValidate.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it will ask for a password. Sometimes these password have rules. 
Either you need to include a number or a mix of uppercase or lowercase 
characters, or have symbol in there. Only when password meets all these 
requirement rules, it will allow us to set as password. So on our page 
here, we have a password input field, and we'll take the submit button 
by its ID. And we'll do a function upon click, and the function will 
have a parameter of event. Then we'll call the event and prevent 
default. And we will take the value of the input field, make it into 
password. So we have variable password equals to password value. Now 
it's time for validation. If the password has not been filled, so the 
password is equal to empty. I will put an alert saying Password is 
required. Then return false. Now we will do some additional validation 
in the password. We will set our password to have a number, an uppercase
 character and lowercase character. And must have a minimum of six 
characters. So if password does not match, So we have slash d, so if it 
does not have a digit, anywhere, if the password match, uppercase A to 
Z. Meaning if it does not have an uppercase character and or if password
 does not have lowercase. So the lowercase alphabet, or password length 
is less than six. So if the password fails to meet any of these 
requirements, we will open the alert saying, the Password is not strong 
enough, and return false. And here we'll submit the form if the password
 is valid. So we have ("data_sheet").submit. So let's take a look at the
 page in the browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
$(document).ready(function () {, he adds, code starts: 
$('#submit_bt').click(function (event) {, event.preventDefault();, var 
password = $('#password').val();, if (password == "") {, alert("Password
 is required");, return false;, }, if (!password.match(/\d/) || 
!password.match(/ [ a-z ] /) || password.length &lt; 6) {, 
alert("Password is not strong enough");, return false;, }, 
$("#data_sheet").submit();, });. Code ends.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can see the password field on our page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He right-clicks the 
passwordValidate.HTML file under the advancedInput folder in the 
Solution Explorer and clicks the View in Browser (Google Chrome) option.
 A web page opens that contains the Password text box and submit button.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we click submit right now, it will tell that the password field is
 required. If we type in some random character, it will say the Password
 is not strong enough. The only way to get through, is that we must type
 in a password that has a number digit, uppercase character, lowercase 
character, and it's got to be at least six digits long. Only then the 
form can be submitted.</p></div>

Using the onSubmit Attribute
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Using the onSubmit Attribute. The presenter is William Shen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this video, we'll demonstrate how to perform an onSubmit 
validation. Previously, our form validation's based on when&nbsp;the 
user clicked the submit button.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The submitValidate.HTML file is open 
in the Microsoft Visual Studio window. The code in this file is 
mentioned in the transcript under the heading "submitValidate.HTML".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, we can also listen when the form is about to submit. So we will 
take form by the ID data_sheet, and we will say submit. This will get 
called before the form is about to be submitted. So what we need to do 
here is simply take the variable postalcode, equal to the input value. 
And we're going to check if the postalcode does not match the format. 
The format will contain an alphabet letter, and also a digit. And you 
will repeat three times. So if it does not match, we'll say alert, the 
postalcode is in the wrong format. And return false. And that's it. If 
the validation passes, it will simply not return false then proceed with
 the submission. Let's take a look at the page inside our browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After the line 
$(document).ready(function () {, he adds, code starts: 
$('#data_sheet').submit(function (event) {, var postalcode =

Exercise: Input Validation with HTML5 and JavaScript
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Exercise: Input Validation with HTML5 and JavaScript.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create a web page with three input field

limit the input to hexadecimal characters, (0-9, A-F). Make another 
input field to accept numbers including a minimum, maximum, and step. 
Make the last field accept a password. Add an onSubmit attribute and use
 JavaScript to verify the three input fields when the Submit button is 
pressed. Do not allow empty fields, and validate the password is at 
least 5 characters long. Now, pause the video and perform the exercise. 
We start with a page that has a form and a submit button.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The Microsoft Visual Studio window is open.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So to put in our first input field, I'll put in text Field 1. And we 
will say, input type text and we'll name this field1. Let's also give 
this an id, which is equal to field1, and we'll put in a pattern, a 
pattern will only include characters upper case from A to F, and/or 
numbers, and we'll put a star to indicate we want as many of these as 
possible. Next, we have Field 2. For our Field 2, the input type, is 
equal to number. And we'll correct the typo on the first one. So type 
equal to number and the name is equal to field2. We will give it an id, 
field2. The max for this number, we 'll set it to 100 and the minimum we
 'll set it to 0. Then, we'll set the step to 5. And lastly, on our 
Field 3, we'll set the input type, to password. And the name is equal to
 field3, as well as the id is equal to field3. And that's it. Let's 
start now on our JavaScript validation upon submit. So, under our 
JavaScript document ready, we're going to put get form by id, data sheet
 and then upon submit we're going to have function with perimeter 
events. Then we're going to say, variable field1 is equal to the value 
inside field1. So if the field1 has not been filled in, then we'll 
create an alert and we'll say, Field 1 is required, then return false. 
Then we'll do the same for Field2. So I'm going to take a shortcut and 
just copy the script over. And again do the same for Field3, simply just
 adjusting some value inside. This is to make sure all three fields are 
filled out. Note that you can use the required attribute to achieve the 
same result. For the purpose of this exercise, I'm showing you how it's 
done through the JavaScript. Then we want to validate the length of 
field3. So if Field3 length is less than five, then we will say, alert 
Field 3 is too short. And return false. This is it. Let's take a look at
 the page in the browser. In our browser, you can see we have three 
input field on display. If we click on Submit, it'll notify us that 
Field1 is required. If we fill in Field1 with some invalid random input,
 it will then ask us to please match the requested format. Now, that 
Field1 is filled and click on Submit it will say, Field2 is required. 
Field2 requires any number from 0 to 100 in the increment of five. So we
 have put in something outside the range it will say value must be 
greater or equal to zero. If I put in a number not in the increment of 
five it'll say the two nearest valid values are 5 and 10. In this case I
 will put in 10 instead. Lastly, Field3 is required. So, it will have a 
length validation. If I put it only three character, it'll say Field3 is
 too short. Only if we fill all criteria will the form be submitted.</p></div>
