The Document Object Model
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: The Document Object Model. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to recognize how JavaScript is 
able to work with web pages using something called the Document Object 
Model. On the screen, we have an HTML document opened in Notepad++. We 
also have a JavaScript external file called Scripts.js, which we refer 
to from the HTML file. On the right side of the screen is a browser that
 is rendering the code that you see on the left, the HTML code. That 
code is representative of something called the Document Object Model. So
 when we talk about the DOM, what we're talking about is this structure 
here that you're looking at.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the html file, the presenter 
highlights the codes from lines 2-19. The code on line 2 is: open 
angular bracket, html, lang = double quote, en, double quote, close 
angular bracket. The code on line 3 is: open angular bracket. head, 
close angular bracket. The code on line 4 is: open angular bracket. 
script src = double quote, Scripts.js, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket. slash, script, close angular bracket. The
 code on line 5 is: open angular bracket, title, close angular bracket, 
JavaScript 139724 The DOM open angular bracket, slash, title, close 
angular bracket. The code on line 6 is: open angular bracket. slash, 
head, close angular bracket. The code on line 7 is: open angular 
bracket. body, close angular bracket. The code on line 8 is: open 
angular bracket, h3, id= double quote, old, double quote, close angular 
bracket, JavaScript DOM, open angular bracket, slash, h3, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 9 is: open angular bracket, p, id=, double 
quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket, This is paragraph 1, 
open angular bracket. slash, p, close angular bracket. The code on line 
10 is: open angular bracket, p, id= double quote, p2, double quote, 
close angular bracket, This is paragraph 2, open angular bracket. slash,
 p, close angular bracket. The code on line 11 is: Open angular bracket,
 button, onclick = double quote, byTagNames, open close curve brackets, 
double quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 12 is: Button by 
Tag Names. The code on line 13 is: open angular bracket. slash, button, 
close angular bracket. The code on line 14 is: Open angular bracket, 
button, onclick, = double quote, changeP2, open close curve brackets, 
double quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 15 is: Button 
Change P2. The code on line 16 is: open angular bracket. slash, button, 
close angular bracket. The code on line 17 is: open angular bracket, p, 
id=, double quote, demo, double quote, close angular bracket, This is 
paragraph 3, open angular bracket. slash, p, close angular bracket. The 
code on line 18 is: open angular bracket. slash, body, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 19 is: open angular bracket. slash, html, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The html tag, the head tag, the script tag, the h1, h3 tag, the p 
tag. The structure of an HTML document is made up of tags, and a 
collection of these tags is what is referred to as the Document Object 
Model. And as the name suggests, each one of these tags is treated as an
 object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes on lines 10, 13 and 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And remember, every object has properties and it has some type of 
functionality, or it could have one of either. What this all means for 
developers is that through the DOM, the Document Object Model, we can, 
in fact, change the document. We can manipulate the entire page. What 
you see on the browser, on the right side of the screen, we can 
manipulate all of this stuff, because of the Document Object Model.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following result is present in the 
browser. This is paragraph 1. This is paragraph 2. This is paragraph 3. 
Between the 2nd and 3rd line there are two buttons titled: Button by Tag
 Names, and Button Change P2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now it's not just the JavaScript that can affect the DOM. The 
Document Object Model is language agnostic, so even Python can access 
the various parts of an HTML document. But back to treating the HTML 
document as individual objects, or the elements as individual objects, 
take a look at the p tag here. It has an attribute called id, and I can 
pass to that attribute whatever I want, whatever value I want. It can be
 p1, p2, it can be demo.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 9, 10 and 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is what I mean by the elements being considered an object. So
 this object has an attribute called id, and I can pass to it any value 
that I want.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights id= open quote p1, close quote, in the code on line 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The button object has a some kind of action attached to it, and that's the onclick event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But it also has properties, so for example I could have given this 
button an id if I wanted to. In fact, I can even give it a name. So if 
we look at the structure of this document, and this is why indentation 
is so important, we can think of the HTML document itself as the main 
object or the parent object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then everything underneath it would be children of the main object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes on line 3 and 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Throughout the series, I have been using getElementById in order to 
identify a particular element that I need to work with. But there are 
other ways to identify these elements. I mentioned just now by name.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the scripts.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And there's another one called getElementsByTagName.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 2. The 
code here is: let tagNames = document.getElementsByTagName, open curve 
bracket, double quote, p, double quote, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, be careful with this getElementsByTagName, because what 
you're going to get back is an array. So just to show you what I'm 
talking about, think of the p, the paragraph tags, as a collection of 
paragraph tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the html file. He highlights the codes on line 9, 10, and 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I have three of them on the screen on this particular HTML 
document. So if I go back to my Scripts.js, notice I'm letting tagNames,
 that's the name of my variable, which will eventually become an array, 
be equal to getElements, with an s, ByTagName. So this, tagNames, will 
end up with an array of three items in it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the Scripts.js file and 
refers to the code on line 2. The code here is: let tagNames = 
document.getElementsByTagName, open curve bracket, double quote, p, 
double quote, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What I'm doing is I'm using a demo tag, which is paragraph 3 at the 
moment, to display whatever is inside of the first paragraph tag in that
 array.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the browser and highlights
 the following text: This is paragraph 3. He then goes to the code on 
line 4. The code here is: tagNames, open square bracket, 0, close square
 bracket, .innerHTML, semi-colon. He highlights 0 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I click the Button by Tag Names, which will fire this function for me, what's going to happen is</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the button titled Button
 by Tag Names, present in the browser. He then goes to the code on line 
1. The code here is: function byTagNames, open close curve brackets, 
open curly bracket. He highlights byTagNames in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that whatever is inside of first paragraph tag will be replaced by. 
Actually, what's inside of the demo tag will be replaced by the first 
paragraph tag, which.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the browser and highlights the following text: This is paragraph 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically what's going to happen is that, This is paragraph 3 will
 be changed to This is paragraph 1. So let's click the button, and there
 it goes. So it says, This is paragraph 1, so it has taken the content 
of paragraph 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on the button titled Button
 by Tag Names, in the browser. The text, This is paragraph 3, changes 
to, This is paragraph 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let me just refresh this browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser and the 
original result appears again, showing the following text: This is 
paragraph 1, This is paragraph 2, and This is paragraph 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So like I said, we could also getElementsByName or getElementByName, and that's mainly used by HTML designers.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the following part of the code on line 2: document.getElementsByTagName.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Of course you would have to put a name. Instead of using an id, you 
can use a name or, in fact, you can use both, because both name and ids 
are attributes of the paragraph tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the html file and 
refers to the code on line 9, which is open angular bracket, p, id= 
double quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket, This is paragraph
 1, open angular bracket. slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I mentioned that the HTML document is a collection of elements, 
and there's a relationship between these elements. So for example, the 
body tag on line 7, underneath it there's an h3 tag, so we can think of 
the h3 tag as a child of the body element. The body element is a child 
of the document itself, the HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to h3 in the code on line 
8, which is open angular bracket, h3, id= double quote, old, double 
quote, close angular bracket, JavaScript DOM, open angular bracket, 
slash, h3, close angular bracket. He highlights the code on line 2, 
which is open angular bracket, html, lang = double quote, en, double 
quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in this way, we can set up a relationship. In fact, we can 
consider the h3 tag, h3 element, as the first child of the body element.
 And the p tag down at the bottom, the demo tag, would be the last 
child.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the codes on line 8 and 
17. The code on line 8 is: open angular bracket, h3, id= double quote, 
old, double quote, close angular bracket, JavaScript DOM, open angular 
bracket, slash, h3, close angular bracket. The code on line 17 is: open 
angular bracket, p, id= double quote, demo, double quote, close angular 
bracket, This is paragraph 3, open angular bracket. slash, p, close 
angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we can also think of the structure as nodes and node elements. So I
 have an example of what I'm talking about. Let's go to the Scripts 
file, and my second function will get the first paragraph 2 in our HTML,
 so it should say, This is paragraph 2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the Scripts.js file. He 
highlights the code on line 6. The code here is: function changeP2, open
 close curve brackets, open curly bracket. He then goes to the code on 
line 7. The code here is: document.getElementById, open curve bracket, 
double quote, p2, double quote, close curve bracket.innerHTML =. He 
highlights p2 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But it's going to put it into paragraph 1 using the firstChild.nodeValue property of that p1 tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 8. The 
code here is: document.getElementById, open curve bracket, double quote,
 p1, double quote, close curve bracket, .firstChild.nodeValue, 
semi-colon. He highlights .firstChild.nodeValue in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically innerHTML and firstChild.nodeValue is about the same thing.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights .innerHTML in line 7, and .firstChild.nodeValue in line 8.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's see how that works. If I refresh the browser screen, click on Button Change P2, and you will see</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Button Change P2, in the browser. The text, This is paragraph 2, changes to, This is paragraph 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that, This is paragraph 1, has now been replaced by what was there 
before. Let's refresh that, remember it was paragraph 2. Click the 
button, now it's paragraph 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser and the 
original result appears again. He again clicks on Button Change P2, in 
the browser. The text, This is paragraph 2, changes to, This is 
paragraph 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically what I'm doing is I'm taking the firstChild.nodeValue of
 my p1 tag, which is this right here, the content, and putting it into 
the innerHTML content of p2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights firstchild.nodevalue 
and p1, in the code on line 8. He then highlights the first instance of 
text, This is paragraph 1, in the browser. He then highlights innerHTML 
and p2, in the code on line 8, and then highlights the second instance 
of text, This is paragraph 1 in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And there are several other ways of working with the Document Object Model, but this is just a basic introduction to this.</p></div>

Working with DOM Events
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Working with DOMEvents. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about how JavaScript work 
with DOM events. On the left side of the screen is an HTML document 
opened. It is pointing to a JavaScript file on line 3, which is the 
second tab of my Notepad++ document or application. There's also 
JavaScript around lines 18 to 25.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes from line 18 
to 25. The code on line 18 is: open angular bracket, script, close 
angular bracket. The code on line 19 is: document . getElementByID, open
 curved bracket, double quote, button 1, double quote, close curved 
bracket, .addEventListener, open curved bracket. The code on line 20 is:
 double quote, click, double quote, comma change P2, close curved 
bracket, semi-colon. The code on line 21 is: document . getElementByID, 
open curved bracket, double quote, p2, double quote, close curved 
bracket, .addEventListener, open curved bracket, double quote, click, 
double quote, comma. The code on line 22 is: function, open close curved
 bracket, open curly bracket. The code on line 23 is: alert, open curved
 bracket, double quote, Hello Skillsoft !, double quote, close curved 
bracket, semi-colon. The code on line 24 is: Close curly bracket, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon. The code on line 25 is: open angular 
bracket, / script, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the right side of this screen is the Chrome browser rendering the code that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the JavaScript browser, the 
following text appears on the screen: JavaScript DOM. This is paragraph 
1, This is paragraph 2, This is paragraph 3. It also has the following 
two buttons: Button by Tag Names, Button Change P2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm using an example that I've probably used before, an example 
where we have already seen the button click event. We may have also seen
 the hover event. So just to back up a little bit, remember that the 
Document Object Model is a term that represents the structure of an HTML
 page. An HTML document can be thought of as a collection of HTML 
elements or a node tree with relationship between the nodes. Attached to
 these nodes or elements of an HTML page are events. Think of events 
like the functionality of HTML element objects. These objects can be 
clicked on, they can be hovered over, or they can be loaded. They can be
 moved, they can be changed, they can be submitted. So far in this 
series, I have demonstrated the click event, and I may have demonstrated
 the mouse over event as well. So in other videos, I may have done an on
 click event, I have attached the on click event to a button object. So 
in the case of the on click event, it was an attribute that was calling a
 function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code line 14. The 
code is: Open angular bracket, button, i d =, double quote, button 1, 
double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, there is another way to access the functionality of objects 
on the browser. For example on line 19, what I have is, well, first of 
all, I'm attaching or accessing the button1 object in this case, which 
is on line 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 19 is: document . 
getElementByID, open curved bracket, double quote, button 1, double 
quote, close curved bracket, .addEventListener, open curved bracket. He 
points to 'button 1' from the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm saying that, go ahead and grab that object, but attach to that object an event, or an EventListener in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to addEventListener from the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That EventListener will take two parameters. First of all, it needs to know the type of event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights click from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So is it a click, is it a change, is it a hover event? And it also needs to know what it needs to do if that event ever happens.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights changeP2 from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically button1 is listening for an event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to button1 and addEventListener from the code line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The click event, and when it happens, I need to call this function here, changeP2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to changeP2 from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That function is declared and defined on the Scripts.js file, which is an external JavaScript file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: Scripts.js.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And all it's really doing is changing the innerHTML of the paragraph 2
 tag that you see on the right side of your browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 2. The code 
is: document .getElementByID, open curved bracket, double quote, p2, 
double quote, close curved bracket, .innerHTML =. He refers to 
innerHTMLin the code. He then highlights the following text on the 
browser: This is paragraph 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It's changing that line to the line from paragraph 1. So where it says, This is paragraph 2, will become</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 3. The code 
is: document .getElementByID, open curved bracket, double quote, p1, 
double quote, close curved bracket, .firstChild.nodeValue, semi-colon. 
He highlights p1 from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>This is paragraph 1, once I click this button.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the following button on the browser: Button by Tag Names.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the button is listening to that event, that click event, and once it happens, it'll fire the changeP2 function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights addEventListener from the code line 19. And, then he highlights click, and changeP2, from the code line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now notice that when I call the function I don't use the parentheses.
 I simply put the name of the function within the parameter brackets of 
the addEventListener. So notice that there is no on click attribute of 
the button, button1 in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights button 1, from code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But I did have to give it an id because I needed to access that particular button as opposed to the button underneath it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights id, from code line 14. 
He goes to the code line 17. The code is: open angular bracket, p id = 
double quote demo, double quote, close angular bracket, This is 
paragraph 3, open angular bracket, / p, close angular bracket. He 
highlights open angular bracket, p id = double quote demo, double quote,
 close angular bracket from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Or where is it? There's another button here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 11. The code is: open angular bracket, button, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I wanted to make sure that I'm clicking the right button or accessing the right button.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, button 1 from code line 14, and, P2 from code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the button that I'm looking for is the button that has the caption Button Change P2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's this button here. So if I click this, paragraph 2 should 
change to paragraph 1. So let's click that. And notice that it says this
 is paragraph 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Button Change P2. The 
text, This is paragraph 2, changes to, This is paragraph 1. A pop-up box
 opens up with the following text: This page says: Hello Skillsoft !.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Okay, so what's showing up there is the other event that I wanted to 
talk about. So let's click OK on that for now. I'm going to refresh the 
browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser screen. This is paragraph 1 changes to This is paragraph 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the second event that I wanted to talk about is how we can add event listeners other than the click event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the .addEventListener from the code line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Actually, I meant to say we can add the click event to other elements
 as well. So even the p2 tag, we can add an event listener to that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights p2 from the code line 21. He highlights addEventListener from the code line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that event listener happens to be the click event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights click from the code line 21.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It could be the hover event, it doesn't matter. The idea is that we 
can attach events to any object on the page. So again, once I click on 
paragraph 2, I will get this message</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A message box appears with the following text: This page says: Hello Skillsoft !.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>because that's what I'm saying in terms of the definition of the 
function. It's an anonymous function, and I'm simply issuing an alert 
statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes from line 22 
to 24. The code on line 22 is: function, open close curved bracket, open
 curly bracket. The code on line 23 is: alert, open curved bracket, 
double quote, Hello Skillsoft !, double quote, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon. The code on line 24 is: Close curly bracket, close curved 
bracket, semi-colon. He highlights the code line 23.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's what happened when I click on paragraph 2. So I click OK to get rid of that message.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Ok to close the message box.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the idea is that we can add events to any object on the HTML document.</p></div>

Manipulating Pages with JavaScript
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Manipulating Pages with JavaScript. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration I'm going to continue to work with the Document
 Object Model, the DOM. And we're going to see how easy it is to affect 
the style of our HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> An html file, and a Scripts.js file 
are open in notepad++. The screen also shows a browser that is rendering
 the codes in notepad++.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I have opened on the screen on the left hand side an HTML document. 
That document on line 4 is pointing to an external Scripts.js file,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket. script src= double quote, Scripts.js, double quote, close 
angular bracket, open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and that JS file is on my second tab in my Notepad++. And we've seen code like this before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the Scripts.js file. He 
refers to the code on line 2. The code here is: document.getElementById,
 open curve bracket, p, close curve bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to switch back over to my HTML document. Notice that on my 
HTML document I do have a button. And that button is pointing to a 
changeStyle function that's going to be declared and defined on my 
external JavaScript file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the html file and 
refers to the code on line 11. The code here is: Open angular bracket, 
button, onclick = double quote, changeStyle, open curve bracket, open 
quote, p2, close quote, close curve bracket, double quote, close angular
 bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the right of your screen there's a current browser. That browser 
will render all of the changes that we make to the HTML itself, and the 
JavaScript, of course.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text is present in the 
browser: This is paragraph 1. This is paragraph 2. This is paragraph 3. 
Between the 2nd and 3rd line, there is a button titled: Change Style.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to now switch to my JavaScript file and change the 
function to affect some style on the page itself. So let's go over to 
the JavaScript file itself.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights changeStyle in the code on line 11. Then he shifts to the Script.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now notice also that when I call this function I'm passing it, the element, the HTML element that I need the function to affect.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the html file and highlights p2 in the code on line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this case it's the paragraph 2, so that this paragraph on the HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the text, This is paragraph 2, in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So over in my Scripts file, whatever I pass into p will get affected when the page is rendered.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the Scripts.js file and refers to the code on line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we've seen inner HTML before, but today I want to talk about 
styles. So instead of innerHTML I can access the style property of my 
element. In this case it's paragraph 2. And I can also affect the 
fontStyle of that element and I can say that I want that fontStyle to 
change. Right now, it's just the normal, whatever the default browser 
has rendered it as. However, I can change it by letting the HTML 
document know that I want to change this to italic, not italics, but 
italic.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 2, after open 
curve bracket, p, close curve bracket, he adds .style .fontStyle = 
double quote, italic, double quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to save that change. I'm going to refresh the browser, 
click on this Change Style button. Now take a look at what's going to 
happen to paragraph 2. Click on that, it changes to italic.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Change Style in the browser. The font style of the text, This is paragraph 2, changes to italic.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll refresh the browser screen to get it back to the way it was before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refreshes the browser and the original text appears again.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And in fact, we can do this with a number of different styles. So for
 example, fontBold, actually I think it's fontWeight. I can make that 
fontWeight be bold, save the change, refresh the browser screen, click 
on the button and the entire paragraph is now bold.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 2, the presenter 
changes fontStyle, to fontWeight, and italic, to bold. He then saves the
 changes and goes to the browser. He clicks on the Change Style button. 
The text, This is paragraph 2, appears in the bold font.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, this is all well and good. But when it does come in handy is, 
for example, let's go back to our HTML page, is I can copy the style 
from one element and apply it to another element. So let's just say that
 the style that I have</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the html file, he goes to the code
 on line 9. The code here is: open angular bracket, p, id= double quote,
 p1, double quote, close angular bracket, This is paragraph, 1, open 
angular bracket. slash, p, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>on my paragraph 1 tag happens to be the color style. So my color is, let's make it red. My color is red now on paragraph 1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 9, by 
adding style = double quote, color:red, semi colon, close quote, between
 double quote and close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that change. Refresh the browser screen. There's my paragraph 1, the color has changed.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The color of the text, This is paragraph 1 changes to red, in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It is possible, using the style from one tag, to copy the style from 
one tag into another tag. Or the style from one element into another 
element. Let's head back over to the function that we were working with,
 and I can say that I want the color. Well, let me first of all copy 
line 2, you'll see why in a moment. So I'm copying line 2 and I'm 
pasting it again. So I now have two document.getElementBy.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the Scripts.js file and copies the code on line 2. He pastes it on line 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So remember, whenever we affect changes concerning the DOM, we first 
of all have to identify the element that we're working with. So in this 
case, it's the paragraph 2 tag from the HTML.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights p in the codes on line 2 and 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Remember when I called this changeStyle function I'm passing p2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 1. The 
code here is: function changeStyle, open curve bracket, p, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket. He highlights changeStylein the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Okay, so it is possible instead of fontWeight I can, let's see, 
instead of fontWeight, I say the color is going to be equal to. So I'm 
going to remove this entire double quotes with the value in it. And 
that's now going to be equal to document.getElementById. And I'm going 
to actually copy from my p1 tag, I'm going to copy the color.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on lines 2 and 
3. The new code on line 2 is: document.getElementById, open curve 
bracket, p, close curve bracket, .style.color, =. The code on line 3 is:
 document.getElementById, open curve bracket, double quote, p1, double 
quote, close curve bracket, .style.color, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just that simple change, let's save all of the changes, 
refresh your browser screen. Now when I click on Change Style, This is 
paragraph 2 should change to red. So if I click on it, it changes to 
red.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks on Change Style in the browser. The color of the text, This is paragraph 2 changes to red.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is a way that we can work with JavaScript and make our web pages a little bit more dynamic.</p></div>

jQuery for Front End Development
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: jQuery for Front End Developer. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to start looking at jQuery. As 
usual, I have an HTML document open in Notepad ++. I also have an 
external JavaScript file that I'm going to refer to. And it is on the 
second tab of my Notepad ++. On the right side of the screen, there's a 
Chrome browser rendering the file that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, the following 
text is present: jQuery Introduction. This is paragraph 1. This is 
paragraph 2. A button labeled as: Big Bad button, and, This is paragraph
 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library, and what that means is that 
underneath jQuery is just JavaScript. And that what jQuery does is that 
it takes a lot of the functionality that developers would normally want 
to work with. And jQuery has encapsulated that into small, easy to use 
functions. This means the developers need to write less code once they 
have included the library. Of course, you have to include the library in
 your code. And it means that now you can access the various functions 
in that library with regular jQuery calls or JavaScript code. Other 
advantages of using jQuery, it means time saving common tasks like 
manipulating styles is easier to perform now with jQuery. Of course, 
compatibility is also important and because jQuery is maintained by the 
general public, it is free to use.</p>
<p>You don't have to pay for jQuery. jQuery also has tools that will 
listen to the user interaction and you can respond to those actions. 
jQuery can make it very easy to create simple animations. And it also 
has tools to let you communicate with the server without the user having
 to reload the page, something known as Ajax. Keep in mind though that 
jQuery, even though it can be used on the server side, it was really 
meant for front end development. Now, in order to use jQuery, we have 
two choices. I can go to the jQuery.com website and simply download the 
latest version. Or I can actually include the jQuery library from a CDN,
 a Content Delivery Network, which is what I'm going to do. I'm going to
 access the Google's Content Delivery Network, and include my jQuery 
from there. So if we take a look at line 4 on the HTML document, I am 
going to include</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: open angular 
bracket, title, close angular bracket, JavaScript 139727, jQuery, open 
angular bracket, / title, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>some script tags and the source is actually going to be an Internet 
website. It's going to be the Google website, and I will get the jQuery,
 the minified version, from that location.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He executes a code on line 4. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script src =, double quote, https: // 
ajax .googleapis .com/ ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery .min .js, double 
quote, close angular bracket, open angular bracket /script, close 
angular bracket, The existence code shifts on line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, once I have that, of course, I have to have another script tag 
pointing to my Scripts.js file. So once I have both of these installed, I
 can then, let's save those changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Go back to my Scripts.js file and this is the way we would start working with jQuery.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: Scripts.js.
 The following lines of codes are present: The code on line 1 is: $ 
sign, open curved bracket, documents, close curved bracket, .ready, open
 angular bracket, function, open close curved bracket, open curly 
bracket. The code on line 2 is: // do stuff. The code on line 3 is: 
close curly bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>This can be literally interpreted as first, creating a document 
object based on the web page that we're working with. Then call the 
ready function while passing to that ready function and another 
anonymous function, which will then execute stuff. So like I said, we 
can do stuff here. So once the document is loaded, this function will 
execute and I can have something happen. So I can do an alert for 
example, and I can say alert,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Document loaded.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 2, he removes the 
existing code and writes the following code: alert, open curved bracket,
 open quote, document loaded, close quote, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes. Now, when I refresh the browser screen, this 
function should fire once the page itself is loaded. So let's refresh 
the screen, and there's my document loaded.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. A message opens up with the following 
text: This page says: document loaded</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Great, so because we do this every single time, we worked with 
JavaScript, worked with jQuery, then it means then that this entire 
piece of the code can now be reduced to just this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code from line 1 to 3. He then removes most of the code, the remaining code is: $ ();.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So within those parentheses, I can have my alert method call to JavaScript. And I can pass it something like, Document loaded.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes the following text on line 
1: $ sign, open curved bracket, alert, open curved bracket, open quote, 
documentn loaded, close quote, close curved bracket, close curved 
bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Refresh the browser screen, and as you can see, it works the same way.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. A message opens up with the following 
text: This page says: document loaded</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we'll explore jQuery a little bit more in other videos.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="a14b4e50-80f5-11e8-a838-85d1c8adc692">
jQuery Elements
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: jQuery Elements. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to continue working with jQuery. And
 in particular, we're going to take a look at selectors in jQuery, 
traversing over the DOM, using attributes to find items on the page, and
 even filtering. I have two applications open. On the left it's 
Notepad++, and there are three files that we're going to be working with
 today, an HTML file, which you're seeing on the screen now. And there's
 a Chrome browser on the right side of your screen, rendering that HTML 
file that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following result is displayed in the 
browser: This is paragraph 1. Item One. Item Two. This is paragraph 3. 
Item one and Item Two are written in bullet points, where the font of 
Item One is larger than that of Item Two. There is a button titled Big 
Bad Button, above This is paragraph 3. In notepad ++, there are three 
files. html file, scripts.js, and styles.css.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML file has jQuery being attached to that file via a CDN, Google APIs.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the html file, he refers to the 
code on line 4. The code here is: open angular bracket, script src =, 
double quote, https://ajax.gooleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we're also using an external JavaScript file, as well as a CSS styles sheet.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the codes on line 5 and 
6. The code on line 5 is: open angular bracket, script src =, double 
quote, Scripts.js, double quote, close angular bracket, open angular 
bracket, slash, script, close angular bracket. The code on line 6 is: 
open angular bracket, link, rel, =, double quote, stylesheet, double 
quote, type, =, double quote, text/css, double quote, href, =, double 
quote, styles.css, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first thing that we're going to do is select an element on this page, in fact, we're going to be selecting the p1 tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 11. The 
code here is: open angular bracket, p, id=, double quote, p1, double 
quote, close angular bracket, This is paragraph 1, open angular bracket,
 /p, close angular bracket. He highlights p1 in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we will affect something on that p1 tag. In fact, we're going to 
add a style to that p1 tag. This is a paragraph. If I go over to my 
JavaScript file, I can start writing the necessary code to be able to do
 that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts to the scripts.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, by this code, what I'm saying is that I want to select the p1 
tag. And I do this by putting in the name next to the hash symbol. And 
what I want to do with that p1 tag is add some CSS to it. The CSS that 
I'm going to be adding is that I'm going to be changing its color. So I 
can simply pass to that CSS method the color that I want to have changed
 and the value of that color, let's say brown in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code in line 2.
 The code here is: $ open curve bracket, double quote, #p1, double 
quote, close curve bracket, .css, open curve bracket, double quote, 
color, double quote,double quote, brown, double quote, close curve 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the changes, refresh the screen and there's the change that you see right there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The color of This is paragraph 1 changes to brown.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I could remove the hash symbol as well as the 
selector itself, p1 in this case, save the changes, refresh the screen. 
And now it's affecting all of the paragraphs on the page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 2, the presenter 
changes #p1, to p. He saves the change and refreshes the browser. The 
Color of This is paragraph 1, and This is paragraph 3, changes to brown.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, the list items is wrapped up inside of a paragraph tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to Item One, and Item Two, present in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, of course there's a way to get to the items themselves. But 
just using the p tag in this case will not affect the inner parts of 
that particular paragraph tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now I can also add other styles to the paragraph tags, in this case. 
But if I wanted to do that, I will have to wrap up what I have at the 
moment within these curly braces and remove the comma and put in a colon
 instead. I'll save these changes, refresh the browser screen, nothing 
happens.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 2. The 
code here is: $ open curve bracket, double quote, p, double quote, close
 curve bracket, .css, open curve bracket, open curly bracket, double 
quote, color, double quote:double quote, brown, double quote, close 
curly bracket, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But it means now that I can do something like this. I can add, let's say font-weight and make that font-weight, bolder.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 2. The 
code here is: $ open curve bracket, double quote, p, double quote, close
 curve bracket, .css, open curve bracket, open curly bracket, double 
quote, color, double quote:double quote, brown, double quote,double 
quote, font-weight, double quote:double quote, bolder, double quote 
close curly bracket, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the changes and now, I have two styles affecting the page. So not only is it brown, it's now bolded.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser, the font of, This is paragraph 1, and This is paragraph 3, changes to bold, and is brown in color.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But what if I only wanted to affect the last column or the last 
paragraph or the first paragraph? Well, I can do that simply by adding a
 particular method, first, last, etc.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 2, the presenter adds .last, open close curve brackets, before .css.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the changes, refresh the browser screen, and now only the last paragraph is being affected by all of this CSS.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser, the font of, This is 
paragraph 3, changes to bold, and is brown in color, while This is 
paragraph 1 goes back to its original font and color.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I also mentioned in the opening that we can access elements by 
their attributes. So one of the attributes, if we go back to our HTML 
document, let's take a look at line 14. And, this is one of the list 
items and it's associated with a particular class.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the html file. The 
code on line 14 is: open angular bracket, li class, =, double quote, 
sizes, double quote, close angular bracket, Item One, open angular 
bracket, slash, li , close angular bracket. He highlights class, =, 
double quote, sizes, double quote, in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now that class was defined in my Styles.css where I am increasing the font by 1.2 times everything else.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the styles.css file. He refers to the code on line 2. The code here is: font-size:1.2em, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is why Item One appears larger than Item Two. So back on the Scripts.js file, I can actually target either one of these.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the scripts.js file and then points to Item One and Item Two in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's target the first one. So I know that there's a class, let's 
take a look at it again, the class, and there's a size as well. Well, 
there's the name of the style that is being applied to Item One in this 
case, which makes it bigger.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the html file and highlights the code on line 14. He then points to Item One in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's go back to our Scripts.js file. And I'm going to use that information to target just Item One in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes back to the scripts.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So for that I'm going to use square brackets, and I'm going to say 
that my class is equal to, I'll have to use single quotes here, sizes. 
Okay, well, we can't use the last anymore because now we're just 
targeting one individual item.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 2, he replaces p 
with, open square bracket, class, =, open quote, sizes, close quote, 
close square bracket. He also removes .last, open close curve brackets, 
from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save that change, refresh the browser screen, and there you 
see only Item One is being affected by the color and the weight and that
 sort of thing.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser, the color of Item One changes to brown, and the font changes to bold.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So jQuery is extremely powerful when it comes to selecting items and 
changing the styles and making it look different. And, of course, it 
does all of this by being able to identify the element that you want to 
work with, and then using the styles to affect that element.</p></div>

jQuery Events
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: jQuery Events. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration I'm going to continue with jQuery and talk 
about events in jQuery. On the screen I have Notepad opened up and it's 
pointing to an html file. That file is pointing to, well, first of all, 
we're getting the library, the jQuery library from Google.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter points to the code line
 4. The code is: open angular bracket, script src =, double quote, 
https: // ajax .googleapis .com/ ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery .min .js,
 double quote, close angular bracket, open angular bracket /script, 
close angular bracket, .</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And on line 5 I'm pointing to a Scripts.js file, an external JavaScript file</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 5. The code 
is: open angular bracket src =, double quote, Scripts.js, double quote, 
close angular bracket, open angular bracket, / script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>where we'll be writing our events or I should say our event handlers.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: Scripts.js.
 The following lines of codes are present: The code on line 1 is: $ 
sign, open curved bracket, documents, close curved bracket, .ready, open
 angular bracket, function, open close curved brackets, open curly 
bracket. The code on line 3 is: close curly bracket, close curved 
bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the right side of your screen is a Chrome browser with the developer tools opened.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On browser page following text are 
present: jQuery Introduction. This is paragraph 1. It has 2 sub-points: 
Item One. Item Two. A button named as: Big Bad button, and, This is 
paragraph 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And let's start with one of the first events I want to talk about, is the hover event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: Scripts.js.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, jQuery has all kinds of events. There's a click event, focus 
event, blur event, etc. Keep in mind though that the HTML API events 
don't necessarily map directly by name to jQuery events or methods. They
 may be slightly different. So back on our HTML file we do have a few 
paragraph tags, and one of them is labeled p1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: html file. 
He goes to the code line 10. The code is: open angular bracket, p, id =,
 double quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket, This is 
paragraph 1, open angular bracket, / p, close angular bracket. He 
highlights, p1 from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to target this p1 tag where it says this is a paragraph,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, he highlights This is paragraph 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>this is paragraph one, let's work with that for now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He switches to tab title: Scripts.js.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to target that in the usual way by using my dollar sign.
 And then identifying p1. And from that point on I can attach the hover 
method to this. And I can then pass it a function. And within the body 
of that function I can tell it what I want to do. In this case I want it
 to log something to the console. So console.log. And a simple message. 
Something like that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 2 &amp;, 
3. The code on line 2 is: $ sign, open curved bracket, double quote, 
hash p1, double quote, close quote bracket, .hover, open curved bracket,
 function, open close curved bracket, open curly bracket. The code on 
line 3 is: console .log, open curved bracket, double quote, You have 
just hovered over p1, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save our changes, refresh the browser screen. Now as I move my mouse over paragraph one, it should pop up in the window.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He points to the This is paragraph 1, 
the following text appears on the console window: Number 2. You have 
just hovered over p1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now notice every time I move over the paragraph the number on the left increases.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The number is kept on increasing when he points the This is paragraph 1</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's great for some other development analysis, but for now 
let's just work with Events. Now this works fine and it does its job, 
but most times developers will make use of the on method. The on method 
makes its possible for us too, as developers, to attach multiple events 
to one function. So let's access the on method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 2, he highlights hover. He replaces the hover with on.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that on method we will pass to that on method to parameters. The 
first parameter will be mouseenter. Now remember, I did say that the 
jQuery methods or the jQuery event names will be different from the HTML
 APIs.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 2, he modifies the code.
 the new code is: $ sign, open curved bracket, double quote, hash p1, 
double quote, close curly bracket, .on, open curved bracket, double 
quote, mouseenter, double quote comma, function, open close curved 
bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we have a function, and let's just make sure that this function is the way it's supposed to be. Let's remove this semicolon.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes the semi-colon from code line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>All right, so within that function is where we will be passing or 
we'll be defining what is supposed to happen. So what is supposed to 
happen is that the console window log is going to be passed a message. 
And that message is, You have just entered p1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 3. The 
new code is: console .log, open curved bracket, double quote, You have 
entered p1, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Now, if I move over paragraph one it should fire, and there it is.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He points to the This is paragraph 1, 
the following text appears on the console window: You have entered p1,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the question now becomes, how do we handle multiple events? We've 
already seen the mouseenter event. And we can, if we wanted to, add the 
mouseleave event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 2, after mouseenter, he types comma, mouseleave.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the browser screen. Now as I enter the 
paragraph, it fires. And as I leave the paragraph, it also fires. So now
 you see two of them, you see two messages down there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He points to the This is paragraph 1, 
the following text appears on the console window: Number 2. You have 
entered p1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But this code is not very intuitive. Let's try to restructure it a 
little to make it developer-friendly. So once again we start with on. 
Let me just get rid of some of these lines here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 2 and 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I need to do this in order for me to be sure that I know exactly 
what I'm doing. So let's put in our parenthesis first, our curly braces 
first. Then from there we can start adding events. So the first event is
 mouseenter, colon and then we'll pass it at mouseenter property a 
function. And within that function we will define what we want to have 
happen. So the first thing that we want to have happen is log. And we 
want to log some kind of message.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code from line 2 to 
4. The new code on line 2 is: $ sign, open curved bracket, double quote,
 hash p1, double quote, close curly bracket, .on, open curved bracket, 
open curly bracket. The new code on line 3 is: mouseenter : function, 
open close curved bracket, open curly bracket. The new code on line 4 
is: console .log, open curved bracket, double quote, you have entered 
p1, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you have entered p1. Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Let's see if it works. And it does work.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He points to the part, This is paragraph
 1, the following text appears on the console window: you have entered 
p1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it means then that, let's clean up the code a bit. It means then 
that all I have to do add another event is simply copy and paste.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies the code from line 3 to 5 and pastes it from line 6 to 8.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And, of course, put a comma between the two of them. So now I can do a mouseleave event.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 5 and adds 
comma after close curly bracket. He goes to the code line 6 and, 
highlights word enter from the code. He replaces the word enter with 
leave.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I can say you have left p1.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 7 and replaces the word entered with left.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the browser screen, enter, leave.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He points to the This is paragraph 1, 
the following text appears on the console window: you have just entered 
p1. you have left p1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in this way we can add as many events to our on method as required.</p></div>

jQuery Effects
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: jQuery Effects. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to continue the conversation on 
jQuery. We're going to take a look at jQuery Effects. And there are 
quite a few of them. On the screen, I have a JavaScript file open. This 
is an external JavaScript file that is attached to an HTML document, as 
you can see here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In notepad ++, a script.js file and a
 html file are open. The presenter goes to the html file, and highlights
 the code on line 5. The code here is: open angular bracket, script, 
src=, double quote, Scripts.js, double quote, close angular bracket, 
open angular bracket, slash, script, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I also have connecting to the Google APIs in order to get the jQuery library via our CDN.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the html file, he refers to the 
code on line 4. The code here is: open angular bracket, script src =, 
double quote, https://ajax.gooleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I have a few HTML tags on this HTML document. There's a couple of p1 tags. There is a button tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the codes on lines 10 
and 17. The code on line 10 is: open angular bracket, p, id=, double 
quote, p1, double quote, close angular bracket, This is paragraph 1, 
open angular bracket, /p, close angular bracket. The code on line 17 is:
 open angular bracket, button id=, double quote, bbb, double quote, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And there's also a checkbox as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 13. The
 code here is: open angular bracket, input type, =, double quote, 
checkbox, double quote, id=, double quote, cb, double quote, /close 
angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've labeled all of them with IDs. Over on the right side, this is a 
Chrome browser that is rendering the document that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Following result is present in the 
browser. This is paragraph 1. There is a check box with the text: Show 
Button! This is paragraph 3. There is a button titled Big Bad Button, 
above This is paragraph 3.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What I want to do is I want to be able to click inside of this 
checkbox. And whenever I do that, I want to have this Big Bad Button 
hidden. When I uncheck the checkbox, then I want to reveal the button 
again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the scripts.js file. He refers to the text written in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's take this one step at a time. The first thing that we should
 do, well, it depends on what you're trying to do at this point, but I 
just wanted to show you how the effects work in jQuery. So let's start 
with hiding the button immediately once the page is loaded. So in order 
to do that, I know that I need a function. So on line 2, I've started 
writing my function. Then what I want to do is I want to be able to 
identify exactly what I'm trying to pick out.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In line 2, he writes: $ open curve bracket, double quote, double quote, close curve bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this case, it is the Show, well, in this case, it's the Big Bad 
Button. I want to hide that first. So let's go over to the HTML 
document. Notice that the id is bbb, so I know that I am targeting</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the html file and refers 
to bbb, written in the code on line 17. The code on line 17 is: Open 
angle bracket, button, id= double quote, bbb, double quote, close angle 
bracket, He goes back to the scripts.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>my #bbb id, whatever that happens to be. And then what I want to do is I want to add the functionality of hiding that item.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 2. The 
new code is: $ open curve bracket, double quote, #bbb, double quote, 
close curve bracket, .hide, open close curve brackets, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So once I have this in place, I can save the changes. Now when I 
refresh the browser screen, this button will go away. Refresh the 
browser screen, it's gone.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The Big Bad Button present on the browser screen disappears when the presenter refreshes the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it's as simple as that, it's just attaching a function, a method,
 to the identifier, the element on the page that you're looking at.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights bbb in the code on line 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But let's make it a little bit more interesting. I want to be able to
 reveal the button when I check this box. So for that, I know I'm going 
to need another function, so let's start writing another function. And I
 know that I need to target the checkbox itself, so let's look for the 
name of that checkbox, it happens to be cb.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the html file and refers 
to cb, present in the code on line 13. The code on line 13 is: Open 
angle bracket, input type = double quote, checkbox, double quote, 
id=double quote, cb, double quote, /, close angle bracket. He goes back 
to the scripts.js file.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now I know that I can target my cb element on the page. But then, 
well, let's back up a little bit. The jQuery does not have a function or
 a method for checking and unchecking things. Basically what you have to
 do is you have to access the change method. So we can access the change
 method and pass it a function of what we need to have happen once that 
change happens. Then I can say, whenever this thing changes, let's 
define what's going to happen inside of this function now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes the following code in line 
3: $ open curve bracket, double quote, #cb, double quote, close curve 
bracket, .change, open curve bracket, function, open close curve 
bracket, close curve bracket, open curve bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I can say something like, okay, well, when it changes, I want my,
 actually I can just copy line 2. I'm just copying line 2 from above and
 pasting it at line 4. So I'm pasting it inside of the change function. 
So I'm saying that when I click this button, I don't want to hide it 
because that won't really show any effect. I want to show the button 
instead.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies the code from line 2 and pastes it on line 4. Then he changes hide, to show in the code on line 4.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save these changes, refresh the browser screen, nothing 
happens. But if I check the button now, or check the checkbox, the 
button should show up.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He checks the check box Show Button, and the Big Bad Button appears on the screen in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But we're still not really doing much. I mean, I can check the button and uncheck it all day long, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He checks and unchecks the check box Show Button, but no change is seen in the browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Basically what we would rather have happen is that when I uncheck the
 button, uncheck the checkbox. I keep saying button, but I mean 
checkbox. When I uncheck the checkbox, I want this button to go away. 
When I click it again, I want the button to come back. So what we really
 need to do is change our function a little bit, our change method. We 
need to insert some kind of logic to capture the effect of the mouse on 
the checkbox. So what I'm going to do, then, is wrap up line 4 in an if 
structure. So if, if what, if this.checked, and by using this, we are 
referring to the element from line 3, so it's the checkbox itself. If 
the checkbox is checked, then what I want to do is I want to show the 
button.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code in line 4.
 The code on line 4 shifts to line 5. The new code on line 4 is: if, 
open curve bracket, this.checked, close curve bracket, open curly 
bracket. He refers to cb in the code on line 3, when he talks about the 
element. He changes the code in line 6. The code on line 6 is, close 
curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, this still won't give me the effect that I'm looking for. So I 
refresh the page, I save the changes, refresh the page, the browser. If I
 check the checkbox, I see the button shows up. If I uncheck it, nothing
 happens, though. So let's wire up that part of it. So I know that I'm 
checking the checkbox, and the button is going to show. Else, what's 
going to happen if I uncheck the checkbox? Well, I can just copy exactly
 what I have on line 5, paste it on line 7, and instead of show, change 
it to hide.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new codes on lines 6 and 7. 
The code on line 6 is : close curly bracket, else, open curly bracket. 
The code on line 7 is: $ open curve bracket, double quote, #bbb, double 
quote, close curve bracket, .hide, open close curve brackets, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save all of these changes, refresh the browser screen. Now I can check, uncheck, check, uncheck.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He checks the checkbox Show Button, and the Big Bad Button appears. He unchecks the checkbox and the Big Bad Button disappears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So there are a lot more of these effects. There are lots, in fact, 
there are simple animation effects that comes right out of the box with 
jQuery.</p></div>

Setting Up Bootstrap
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Setting Up Bootstrap. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we are going to get started with the 
Bootstrap. I have on the screen an HTML document. And on the right of 
your screen is a Chrome browser rendering that document you see on the 
left. Bootstrap is a front end technology, so it's really meant for 
designers. But it's really easy to use for developers as well. The 
Bootstrap itself came out of the Twitter camp, and it's now hosted on 
GitHub, and it is free. And it has a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 
working together to provide a lot of functionality right out of the box.
 That's why it's so popular. But this demonstration is about installing 
Bootstrap. How do we get started with Bootstrap? Well, actually, there's
 a lot of information on their website. And the first thing we're going 
to do is include a meta tag at line 5.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: open angular bracket, meta charset = double quote, utf-8, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And this is going to ensure that the characters that we use on this 
HTML document is compatible with all of the other browsers that support 
Bootstrap. Secondly, I'm going to include the viewport meta tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He executes a code on line 6. The 
code is: open angular bracket, meta, name = double quote, viewport, 
double quote, content = double quote, width=device-width, comma, 
initial-scale=1, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now this is not so important for this demo. But if you're building 
webpages that are going to be used on various types of devices, tablets,
 phones, different sizes of phones, then it's really important that you 
include the viewport meta tag. Now, a lot of these meta tags that I'm 
going to be including will probably run off the side of the page. So 
these are meta tags that you can just copy from the Bootstrap website. 
So the next thing that I'm going to include is the Bootstrap itself,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He executes a code on line 7. The 
code is: open angular bracket, link rel= double quote, stylesheet, 
double quote, href = double quote, https: // maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com 
/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css, double quote, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the Bootstrap code. And as you can see, I'm using their cdn. And so 
at maxcdn, we will get at least the minified version of the CSS. And 
there's one more, well actually there's two more, the other link is 
going</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He executes a code on line 8. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script src = double quote, https: // ajax
 .googleapis.com/ ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery .min .js, double quote, 
close angular bracket, open angular bracket /script, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>to, we've used this in other videos as well, this is the jQuery 
library. And as it turns out, Bootstrap does require jQuery. And there's
 one more file, which is a JavaScript file.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He executes a code on line 9. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script src= double quote, https: 
//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js, double 
quote, close angular bracket, open angular bracket /script, close 
angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And again, we're getting all this from a cdn, as you can see it's the
 minified version of Bootstrap. And these are actually the basic 
components that you will need in order to get started with Bootstrap. 
Now, of course, there are lots of other plug ins that you can add to 
your webpage. But this is the basic amount that you would need, at least
 to get started with Bootstrap. Now just to get us started, I'm going to
 start writing some code. So I'll include a header tag and some text on 
that header tag. I'm also going to have a paragraph tag with some text 
in there as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12 and 
writes the following code: open angular bracket, h1, close angular 
bracket, Bootstrapping my web page, open angular bracket, /h1, close 
angular bracket. On line 13, he writes: open angular bracket, p, close 
angular bracket, Jumbotron example, open angular bracket, /p, close 
angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to wrap up these two HTML elements inside of a div tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On line 12, he writes the following 
code: open angular bracket, div, close angular bracket. On line 15, he 
writes the following code: open angular bracket, /div, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And to get started using Bootstrap, all we really need to do is give 
our div tag some type of class. And we're going to assign this one the 
class of container.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12 and 
modifies the code. The new code is: open angular bracket, div class= 
double quote, container, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and let's just take a look at what we've done so far.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears on the 
screen: Bootstrapping my web page. Jumbotron example.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we put just some simple text inside of a container. A very popular
 class in Bootstrap is something called the jumbotron. So let's take a 
look at what that would like. So I've already got a container class, I'm
 going to include another div tag. So I'm goingot wrap up the code that I
 have on the screen at the moment inside</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On line 13, he writes the following 
code: open angular bracket, div, close angular bracket. On line 16, he 
writes the following code: open angular bracket, /div, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>of another pair of div tags. And for that, I'm going to apply the class of jumbotron.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13 and 
modifies the code. The new code is: open angular bracket, div class= 
double quote, jumbotron, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I save these changes, and let's take a look at how fast I have 
done this change. So I'm going to refresh the browser screen and look at
 that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears on the 
screen: Bootstrapping my web page. Jumbotron example.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Within less than a minute, I'm able to make my webpage pop just by 
including the jumbotron class. So this is how easy it is to get started 
with Bootstrap.</p></div>

Creating a Page with Bootstrap
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Creating a Page with Bootstrap. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to continue talking about Bootstrap.
 And I'm going to put together a few different HTML elements and apply 
bootstrapping classes to those elements. As usual, I have on the screen 
HTML document opened in Notepad++. And on the right of your screen, 
there's a Chrome browser that is rendering the HTML text that you see on
 the left. Now, I've already gone ahead and inserted all of the various 
links and scripts that I need via CDNs.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code from line 6 to 
9. The code on line 6 is: open angular bracket, meta, name = double 
quote, viewport, double quote, content = double quote, 
width=device-width, comma, initial-scale=1, double quote close angular 
bracket. The code on line 7 is: open angular bracket, link rel = double 
quote, stylesheet, double quote, href= double quote, https: // 
maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css, double 
quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 8 is: open angular 
bracket, script src = double quote, https: // ajax .googleapis.com/ 
ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery .min.js, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket /script, close angular bracket, The code 
on line 9 is: open angular bracket, script src = double quote, https: 
//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js, double 
quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have all of the bootstrapping CSS JavaScript file, as well as 
the jQuery library that we've used before. I've already talked about the
 container class and the jumbotron class in another video.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points the code on line 12 and 13.
 The code on line 12 is: open angular bracket, div class = double quote,
 container, double quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 13 is:
 open angular bracket, div class = double quote, jumbotron, double 
quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So today what we're going to be doing is, well, I'm going to be, like
 I said, attempting to insert some various HTML elements and apply 
classes to them. So the first one that I'm going to talk about is 
actually a list. Now, you don't see the tags ul or li, within this,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He scrolls down and highlights the 
codes from lines 20 to 24. The code on line 20 is: open angular bracket,
 div class = double quote, double quote, close angular bracket. The code
 on line 21 is: open angular bracket, a class = double quote, double 
quote, close angular bracket, Apples, open angular bracket / a, close 
angular bracket. The code on line 22 is: open angular bracket, a class =
 double quote, double quote, close angular bracket, Oranges, open 
angular bracket / a, close angular bracket. The code on line 23 is: open
 angular bracket, a class = double quote, double quote, close angular 
bracket, Bananas, open angular bracket / a, close angular bracket. The 
code on line 24 is: open angular bracket, /div, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>between lines 20 and 24, but this is actually a list. In fact, in 
order to just make it a list, all I really have to do is insert the 
list-group class to the list that I'm looking at.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 20. He writes list-group in between the double quotes in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and you really don't see much of a change here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears on the 
screen: Bootstrapping my web page, hope you like it. Jumbotron example. 
Apples Oranges Bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's because Bootstrap sort of associates a list of groups, or the class list-group, with the class list-group-item.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 21. He writes list-group-item, in between the double quotes in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now what I'm going to do is I'll copy the list-group-item class and paste it next to the other two elements of this list.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 21. He 
copies the list-group-item, in between the double quotes, and pastes in 
the code line 22 and 23, in between the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and now we see it's looking like a list.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears like a list 
on the screen: Apples, Oranges, Bananas.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Also, if you notice, it also has a hover effect as I hover over each 
item in that list. And that is how easy it is to work with Bootstrap. As
 a matter of fact, maybe you wanted the first item on that list to be 
the active item. So all I really need to do is insert the word, active, 
for the first list item. If I refresh the page, you notice the item is a
 little bit different from the rest, the first item is little bit 
different from the rest.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 21. He 
writes, active, after item, in the code. He saves the code and refreshes
 the browser page. The following text appears highlighted on the browser
 screen: Apples.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Or you wanted to have it disabled, so all I have to do is add the 
word, disabled, refresh the page, and now I can't click on the Apples 
anymore.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 21. He 
replaces active with disabled in the code. He saves the code and 
refreshes the browser page. The following text appears in the disabled 
mode on the browser screen: Apples.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you can see how this might come in handy if we are attaching all 
of these items, these various classes to JavaScript or jQuery. And then 
have jQuery insert, disabled or active, depending on what you're trying 
to do. Something that JavaScript developers work with a lot are tables, 
in fact, web developers work with tables a lot. Now, there is a table 
here, and the Chrome browser has rendered that entire table as just a, 
well, it kind of look like it's just garbled, jumbled up text.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, he highlights the following text: Make Model Color Year. ToyotaAvalonWhite2014. NissanSentraGold2011.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But with the simple insertion of a Bootstrap class called a table,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 26. The code
 is: open angular bracket, table class = double quote, double quote, 
close angular bracket. He inserts the text, table, in between the double
 quotes in the code on line 26.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>just that one word, table, save the change, refresh the browser 
screen, immediately we have such a much better look and feel to our 
table.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code and refreshes the 
browser page. The text appears in a tabular format on the screen. There 
are four columns in the table, titled: Make, Model, Color, and Year. 
Under Make, there are 2 items: Toyota and Nissan. Under Model, there are
 2 items: Avalon and Sentra. Under Color, there are 2 items: White and 
Gold. Under Year, there are 2 items: 2014 and 2011.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's not all, sometimes our tables can get extremely long. What
 if you wanted to make your table a little bit more user friendly? Then 
maybe we can actually add a striped table, save those changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 26. He writes table-striped, after the word table, within the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen. And now you see, I mean, it doesn't 
really show it that well here, but you can see that if this table was 
extremely long, had a lot of items in it,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code and refreshes the 
browser page. The first row of the table appears in a darker shade in 
comparison to the second row of the table.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>you could see how alternating rows, shaded a little bit, that can 
really make your table pop. And it becomes much easier to read. As a 
matter of fact, if you wanted to have some kind of border around your 
table, all you really had to do is add the table-bordered attribute to 
your class.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 26. He writes table-bordered, after the text, table-striped within the double quotes in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save all of that, refresh the change, and now it even has borders around it,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code and refreshes the browser page. The table now appears with borders around it.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and it really is this simple to use Bootstrap. Many times developers 
have to work with images, and I do have a sample image here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 53. The code
 is: open angular bracket, img src= double quote, JS.jpg, double quote, 
class = double quote double quote, alt = double quote, Image showing 
various web.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And just by adding something like img-rounded,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 53. He adds, img-rounded within the double quotes, after class=, in the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>just that addition will change my image a little bit. So let's 
refresh the browser screen, and it's not much noticeable, but it does 
have some rounded edges.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code and refreshes the 
browser page. The screen shows a background box with six different 
shapes having the following names: XML, jquery, js, HTML, Cloud, and, 
PHP. The background box containing the six different shapes, now has 
rounded edges, which weren't present originally.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>To make it even more rounded, we can actually go with circle.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 53. He replaces, the word rounded with circle.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And once again, save that change, refresh the browser screen, and now my image is sort of circled together.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code and refreshes the 
browser page. The background box containing the six different shapes is 
now slightly circle in shape.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So as you can see, this demonstration was to show you exactly how easy it is to work with the Bootstrap.</p></div>

Working with the BootStrap Grid
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Working with the BootStrap Grid Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to take a look at the grid system in
 Bootstrap. Now on the left of your screen is an HTML document and that 
is opened in Notepad++. On the right of your screen, there's a Chrome 
browser rendering that file that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser, following result is 
displayed: About this course 139733. Heading 1. Heading 2. Under heading
 1, there is an image. Text in Latin appears under all the three 
headings. There is a footer at the end of the page. It contains a 
weblink.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If we take a look at the file on the left, the HTML document, we see 
that we already have links to the various CDNs that I need in order to 
work with Bootstrap. So we have things like the minified version of 
Bootstrap's CSS. We've got jQuery which CSS requires. And we also have 
their own JavaScript file from a CDN as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the codes on lines 6, 7 
and 8. The code on line 6 is: open angular bracket, link rel=, double 
quote, stylesheet, double quote, href=, double quote, https: // 
maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css, double 
quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 7 is: open angular 
bracket, script src =, double quote, https: // ajax .googleapis .com/ 
ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery .min .js, double quote, close angular 
bracket, open angular bracket /script, close angular bracket. The code 
on line 9 is: open angular bracket, script src=, double quote, https: //
 maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js, double 
quote, close angular bracket,open angular bracket /script, close angular
 bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what this is about is about the grid system. And with the grid 
system in Bootstrap we always start with containers. There are two 
classes for containers. There's the regular one which I'll use here and 
there's also the container-fluid. So let's first start with wrapping up 
our code. So, I'm going to shift everything over to the right. All of 
the content between my body tags will be shifted over to the right. That
 makes room now for a new div tag and I'm going to apply to that new div
 tag a class. And that class is going to be the regular container.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 
11. The code here is: open angular bracket, div, class, =, double quote,
 container, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So notice that everything between my body tags is now wrapped up into
 a div class called container. That's a Bootstrap class. Now the way 
this works is that once we have a container we can start including, or 
inserting rows into that container. That takes care of our vertical 
space. But within each row we can then include or insert columns and 
that takes care of our horizontal space. And that's the most important 
one. Because the horizontal spacing is what is important for when we're 
using the same code that would be displayed on a large screen, a tablet,
 as well as a phone. So the grid system is made up of, like I said, rows
 and columns. And what I'm going to do right now is attempt to delineate
 my different columns. So wherever I have an h3 tag, and a paragraph 
tag, I'm going to wrap each of those up into their own columns. So let's
 start with the header 3 on line 12, about this course. So I'm going to 
move that down, or move everything over to the right first. And then 
move that down and then include my first div class.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 
12. The code here is: open angular bracket, div, class, =, double quote,
 double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm not going to identify the classes yet but I'm going to wrap up my second column into its div tag and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new codes on line 17 and 18. 
The code on line 17 is: open angular bracket, /div, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 18 is: open angular bracket, div, class, =, 
double quote, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>do the same thing for the third column.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new codes on line 25 and 26. 
The code on line 25 is: open angular bracket, /div, close angular 
bracket. The code on line 26 is: open angular bracket, div, class, =, 
double quote, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now, I have three different columns, one starting on 12, the other
 on 18 and the last one on line 26. So now that I have all of my various
 columns I can start inserting these columns into a row. So on line 12 
I'm going to insert my first row and that row ends on line 34.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 12, he types row,
 between the two double quotes. The code on line 34 is: open angular 
bracket, /div, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now that I have my row in place I can now attempt to divide up my 
various columns equally. So every row is made up of columns and there 
are 12 columns in total that Bootstrap gives us. So that means that if I
 divide up my columns by four, I will now have three equal spaces on the
 web page. So on line 13 I'm going to include my first class which is 
col-sm-4. And on line 19, that's my second column, and on line 27 will 
be my third column.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The codes on lines 13, 19 and 27 are 
same. The code is: open angular bracket, div, class, =, double quote, 
col-sm-4, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now I have 3 columns divided up by, well, 3 multiplied by 4 will 
give us 12. So that's your 12 columns in total. So again, I'm going to 
move everything over to the right a little bit. Save all of my changes. 
Refresh the browser screen, and there's not much of a difference at this
 moment. But if I stretch the page off to the left you will start seeing
 my three columns.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter refreshes the browser 
screen, and the result shifts a little to the right. The presenter 
stretches the screen, the result appears in three different columns. The
 first column is About this course 139733. The second column is Heading 
1. The third column is Heading 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to move it back over to the right so I can work with the 
code in the Notepad++ window. Now, notice that I do have a footer at the
 bottom. And I wanted to align that footer. Well, let's move it back 
again. I wanted to align this footer with the middle column that I have 
on the web page. So what we're going to need to do then is apply the 
same technique that we apply to the content. We'll need to apply that to
 the footer as well. So what I need to do is wrap up my footer into, 
first of all, a column. So let's start adding div tags between the 
footer tag. So my first div tag will be a class of col-sm-4.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds codes on line 41. The code on
 line 41 is: open angular bracket, /div, close angular bracket. He then 
refers to the code on line 35. The code here is: open angular bracket, 
div, class, =, double quote, col-sm-4, double quote, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I know now that my middle column will include the footer. So what I
 have to do now is put a column to the left of that. And I'm going to 
give it a class of sm-4 as well.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 35. The 
code on line 35 shifts to line 36. The new code on line 35 is: Open 
angular bracket, div, class, =, double quote, col-sm-4, double quote, 
close angular bracket, open angular bracket, /div, close angular 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to insert a column to the right of it and that's also going to get a class of sm-4. If I save these changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 43. The 
code here is: class, =, double quote, col-sm-4, double quote, close 
angular bracket, open angular bracket, /div, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen, you don't see much of a difference. But 
again, if I pull my screen over to the left, you see the footer now is 
placed in the middle column. So that's sort of like an introduction to 
the grid system in Bootstrap.</p></div>

BootStrap Components and Plugins
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Bootstrap Components and Plugins. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration I'm going to continue talking about Bootstrap. 
And we'll take a look at some plugins and extensions that are available 
for Bootstrap. On the left of your screen is an HTML document. And on 
the right of your screen there is a Chrome browser rendering that HTML 
document that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, the following text appears with a drop-box: Bootstrap Plugins and Extensions.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML document on the left has between line 7, or actually between lines 8 and 10, those are the various</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code from line 8 to
 10. The code on line 8 is: open angular bracket, link rel=, double 
quote, stylesheet, double quote, href=, double quote, https: // 
maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css, double

// maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js, double 
quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>lengths to the various CDNs that would get Bootstrap CSS, Bootstrap 
JavaScript, as well as jQuery that Bootstrap relies on. Now, Bootstrap 
became very popular. And as a result there are all kinds of plugins and 
extensions that various community members would have written. And 
they're now available to be used with Bootstrap. For example, there's 
something called star rating, which will give you a nice five stars, 
yellow stars and your users can click on them to rate things like blogs,
 things like items that you're selling. There's something called pricey 
price charts, which will sort of help you create elegant price charts 
and tables for things like numbers. There's a lot of components around 
confirmations. So if you wanted to do special pop up boxes, then there's
 a lot of plugins for that. And there are also regular everyday items as
 well. For example, there's a special calendar with nice colors and 
things that you can use. There's an accordion wizard which will help you
 create special accordions based on your styles and needs. There's also a
 color picker. Now what I have chosen to use for my demonstration is 
something the Bootstrap Combobox. What this does is that it gives me the
 ability to start typing something that I think is in that list, and the
 code is going to complete the word for me. Now I've chosen to use the 
example of Canada, which has ten provinces and three territories. But 
they all have a two letter code and they all have different names, of 
course. And it's nicely coded in a select box from me, which will give 
me the rendering that you see on the right. So what I have on the right 
is a vanilla plain old HTML comes out of the box kind of thing.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the browser page. He clicks on the drop down menu, and a list of options appears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But we want to make this a little bit better. And that we want to 
start typing letters into the box and have the code complete what it 
thinks the word that we're looking for or the province that we're 
looking for. So it is as simple as downloading the set of files that you
 would need from a place like GitHub. And including those files within 
the meta tags of your HTML document. And they also include some snippets
 of code that you would include in the page itself and then the entire 
functionality of this type of a Combo Box is now available. So the first
 thing that I'm going to do then is I'm going to make some space between
 my head tags. And I'm going to include a link to a style sheet.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He shifts the existing code on line 6
 to line 7. He writes the following code on line 6 is: open angular 
bracket, link rel=, double quote, stylesheet, double quote, type=, 
double quote text/css, double quote /, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to point line 6 to that style sheet that I just 
downloaded. Of course, it's a CSS file and I have named it combobox.css.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On line 6, he adds, href=, double quote combobox.css, double quote after css.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's one file. The second file is a JavaScript file, so I'm going to put it right above my closing head tag on line 12.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: open angular bracket, /head, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to include some script tags. And I am going to make the 
source available or make the source point to a JavaScript file, and the 
name of that file is called combobox.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes anew line of code on line 
12. The code is: open angular bracket, script, src=, double quote, 
combobox.js, double quote, close angular bracket, open angular bracket, 
/scripts, close angular bracket. Succeeding codes shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have included within my head tags the two files that I need for 
this particular activity or this particular functionality. Now, on line 
20, there is a start of my select element, HTML element. And I'm going 
to use that and give it a class. So on line 20, I'm going to change my 
select statement to include a class and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 20 is: open angular bracket, select, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>point it to the combobox.css class.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 20. The 
new code is: open angular bracket, select, class=, double quote 
combobox, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more piece of code to put in. And down at the 
bottom, I'm going to include some script tags, again. And I'm going to 
include the document.ready function. I'm going to pass that an anonymous
 function. Now, the rest of what I'm going to insert here comes directly
 from the source code that I downloaded. So they would suggest that you 
include something called combobox.combobox. And again, this is something
 that you can simply download and insert into your code, and that's it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts codes from line 40 to 42. 
The code on line 40 is: $ sign, open curved bracket, document, close 
curved bracket, .ready, open curved bracket, function, open close curved
 bracket, open curly bracket. The code on line 41 is: $ sign, open 
curved bracket, open quote, .combobox, close quote, close curved 
bracket, .combobox, open close curved bracket, semi-colon. The code on 
line 42 is: close curly bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>These are all changes that I would need to make. I can then save all 
of these changes, refresh the browser screen. And notice that all I have
 now is an empty box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears on the 
screen: Bootstrap Plugins and Extensions. The drop-down menu is empty 
now.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But if I were to put my cursor in it and type something like o, for 
example, notice what happens. I get a list of all of the various items 
in my list that include the letter o.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the drop-down menu, he types letter o, and a list of options is displayed.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But as I continue typing so for example n, then, you know, the list 
is now reduced to just the two items that have o and m together. Of 
course, what I'm looking for is Ontario, so I'm going to type one more 
letter, hit the enter key, and I've got Ontario in my Combo Box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He selects, Ontario in the drop-down menu.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it is really this easy to download plugins and to use these plugins in your web page.</p></div>

Exercise: Creating Pages with jQuery and Bootstrap
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Exercise: Creating Pages with jQuery and Bootstrap. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create an interactive HTML web page and 
include examples of the following technology. jQuery, Bootstrap, and an 
example of a Bootstrap plugin. Now you may pause this video, attempt 
this exercise on your own and then return to the video to see how I 
would approach the exercise. The exercise asked us to create an HTML web
 page and include examples of jQuery, Bootstrap, and a Bootstrap 
plug-in. Now, in order for you to do that, you would've had to have 
links to various CDNs. So between line 7 and 9 of my template file,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the codes on lines 7 to 
9. The code on line 7 is: open angular bracket, link rel=, double quote,
 stylesheet, double quote, href=, double quote, https: // 
maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css, double 
quote, close angular bracket. The code on line 8 is: Open angle bracket,
 scripts src= double quote, 
https://ajaz/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js, double quote, close angle 
bracket, open angle bracket, /scripts, close angle bracket. The code on 
line 9 is: open angular bracket, script src=, double quote, https: // 
maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com /bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js, double 
quote, close angular bracket,open angle bracket, /scripts, close angle 
bracket..</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I have included CDN links to the Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery, as well as 
the Bootstrap JavaScript file. Once you have those three CDNs in place, 
you can then go ahead and proceed to use the functionality within them. 
One of the first things that I wanted to do was I wanted to sort of 
separate the heading of my page from the rest of the content itself. So 
for that I'm going to use an example of Bootstrap. So on line 22, I've 
created a special div tag for separating out my headings of that web 
page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 22 is: open angular bracket, div class=, double quote, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 22, I'm going to assign a class of well to that particular div tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On line 22, he writes well, in between the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll save that change, refresh the browser screen, and immediately we see an effect.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears larger on the
 screen: Bootstrapping my web page. Well example.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That's how easy it is to use Bootstrap. Now, for the rest of the 
Bootstrap itself, we need to sort of create a container for our content.
 Then divide up our content into rows, and then within those rows, we 
can have as many columns as we wish. So usually my container goes 
between my body tags. So my body tag starts on line 20 and right 
underneath, I'll have a div class on line 21.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 21 is: open angular bracket, div class= double quote, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'll assign the value of container to that div tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On code line 21, he adds, container, in between the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Once I have a container, I can then go ahead and sort out my rows. So on line 26, I'm going to have my first row,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 26. The code
 is: open angular bracket, div class= double quote, row double quote, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that's going to hold all of the middle content of my page. But lower 
down the page where I have my footer, I'm going to include that as a 
second row.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 43. The code
 is: open angular bracket, div, id=, double quote, footer, double quote,
 class=, double quote double quote, style=, double quote, : ;, double 
quote, close angular bracket. He goes to the code line 43, and adds, 
word row in between the double quotes after class.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 43, that's my second row. So now I have two rows. I'm not 
going to worry about the footer row right now. But definitely the middle
 row that will hold all of my content, I need to now split up that into 
two halves. Remember that we have 12 columns to work with. So on line 
27, I'm going to create my first column, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 27. The code is: open angular bracket, div class= double quote, double quote, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to give it a col span of 6.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 27, and adds, col-sm-6, in between the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Well, let's go to the line 33, where I'm going to give the same class name to that second div.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 33. The code
 is: open angular bracket, div class= double quote, double quote, close 
angular bracket. He goes to the code line 33, and adds, col-sm-6, in 
between the double quotes.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So 6 and 6 is 12, so I'm separating out my two columns into two equal
 spaces. Let's save all of these changes so far. Refresh the browser 
screen. And if I were to drag the left edge of that browser over to the 
left, you will see the two columns appearing there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text appears on the 
screen: Bootstrapping my web page. well example. There are 2 following 
columns : 1st column is named as Exercise 139735. 2nd column is named as
 Heading 1,</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's move it back over to the right and continue working on the code
 itself. So for my next example, I'm going to use something called the 
magnifier effect, which is a Bootstrap plug-in that I found on the 
Internet. Basically what that's going to do, I'm going to apply to an 
image here. I have one image on my web page. And as I move my mouse over
 this image, it should give me a sort of a magnifying effect. So in 
order to do that, I would have had to, of course, include the various 
files that the plugin required. So the first file is a CSS file, I have 
that on line 10.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 10. The code
 is: open angular bracket, link rel=, double quote, stylesheet, double 
quote, href=, double quote, bootstrap-magnify .min.css, double quote, 
close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And on line 11, I am linking to a JavaScript file. And they're both named appropriately. It's a magnifying effect.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code line 11. The 
code is: open angular bracket, script src =, double quote, 
bootstrap-magnify .min.js, double quote, close angular bracket, open 
angular bracket / script, close angular bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And in order for me to use that magnifying effect, all I really need 
to do within the image tag is to include an attribute. And of course, 
you would have gotten this information from the readme file. So that 
attribute is called data-toggle. And that gets a value of magnify.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 36. He adds the following text after img: data-toggle=, double quote, magnify, double quote.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Once that's in place, I'll save the changes, refresh the browser 
screen. And as I hover over the image, notice I get something of a 
magnifying effect.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He hovers the mouse over the image and a
 magnify effect is visible on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, my last example is an example of jQuery. And what I'm going to 
do is I'm going to click this button and have this footer appear. But 
it's going to appear in a faded fashion.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, below the 
Heading 1, the following text is present: A button named as: Click to 
show folder. This is the footer, vertical bar, 
www.somewhereontheinternet.tsr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in order for me to do that, I would, of course, have to make this disappear first because I want it to appear slowly.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the following text on the browser page: This is the footer, vertical bar, www.somewhereontheinternet.tsr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 43, where I have my footer,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the line 43. He writes display:none , in between the double quotes, after style.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to give it a style of display:none. I'll save the changes, refresh the browser screen, and now it's not there anymore.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. The following text on the browser page 
disappears: This is the footer, vertical bar, 
www.somewhereontheinternet.tsr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the effect that I want is to, once I click that button, the button
 that says click to show footer, then I want to fire off a fadeIn method
 from jQuery.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code line 15. The 
code is: $ sign, Open curved bracket, double quote, # footer, double 
quote, close curved bracket, .fadeIn, open curved bracket, 3000, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Which will look to grab my footer, which is the same thing that just</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 3 footer from the code line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>disappeared, and have that fade in over a matter of three seconds. So
 with this document.ready function in place, I can now refresh the 
browser screen. And now if I click on the button, the footer appears 
after three seconds.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the code on Notepad++ file 
and refreshes the browser page. He clicks on button, named Click to show
 footer. The following text on the browser page appears after 3 second: 
This is the footer, vertical bar, www.somewhereontheinternet.tsr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you've seen an example of jQuery. You've seen an example of Bootstrap, and you've also seen an example of a Bootstrap plugin.</p></div>
