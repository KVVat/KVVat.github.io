<h1>JavaScript Front-end Development: Functions &amp; Objects</h1>
<p>JavaScript has rich language features for representing and 
manipulating real world items as data. During this course, you will 
explore the basics of creating and working with functions, as well as 
creating and manipulating objects in JavaScript. Begin by learning how 
to use function arguments and pass functions as values. Next, you will 
study recursive and arrow functions, and learn scoping and how to 
differentiate between local and global variables. As you progress you 
will explore JavaScript's more common predefined functions, and create 
custom objects. Other topics include how to employ the FOR/IN loop, to 
retrieve object properties when their names are unknown;  how to create 
custom objects with constructor functions; how to create object methods;
 how to employ the prototype keyword to add properties and methods to an
 object. Finally, you will learn how to use the PROTOTYPE keyword, to 
implement inheritance, and to extend classes.</p>

JavaScript Functions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Java Script Functions. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>This demonstration, I'm going to discuss JavaScript functions. You'll
 notice that JavaScript functions behave almost exactly like functions 
in other programming languages. I've got two applications open up on my 
screen. On the left is Notepad++ with an HTML document. On the right 
side is Chrome rendering the document on the left. The document on the 
left has JavaScript embedded in the body tags between lines 10 and 18. 
As you can see, line 12 has our function being declared.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: function 
percent plus, open curved bracket, price, comma, p c mark up, close 
curved bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And between 13 and 14, that's the function body.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13 &amp; 14.
 The code on line 13 is: let mark up, =, price, multiplied by, open 
curved bracket, p c mark up, divided by, 100, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon. The code on line 14 is: return price, +, mark up, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The call to that function is being made between lines 16 and 17, so</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 16 &amp; 17.
 The code on line 16 is: p 1, dot, inner HTML, +,=. The code on line 17 
is: double quote, open angular bracket, b r, close angular bracket, 
final, price is, double quote, +, open curved bracket, percent plus, 
open curved bracket, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, close
 curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>17 has the exact call to that function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, percent plus from the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As you can see, the name of our function is percentPlus. It takes two arguments.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, percent plus, open curved bracket, price, comma, p c mark up, close curved bracket, from the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Our call to the function happening on 17 is 2 percentPlus and we are passing it to parameters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, percent plus, open curved bracket, 2, point 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, from the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The chrome browser on the right is showing us what would happen if we attempt to add 15% to a price of $2.85.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, from the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It just so happens that, due to how we string,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, &amp; remove the code line 16 &amp; 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we don't actually have to call our function after the function is declared.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts the code line 16 &amp; 17, at code line 12 &amp; 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We can actually move that function call up to the top. I'll save my 
changes, refresh the browser screen. And as you can notice, nothing 
happened to the price.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. After saving the file, following text 
doesn't change on the screen: Java Script Functions. Final price is, 3, 
point 2 7 7 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to put it back the way it was, because I prefer to have my function declarations above the place where I call them.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He puts the code line 12 &amp; 13 again at code line 16 &amp; 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now it is also possible to call our function without ever passing in 
any parameters or less parameters than the function is requesting.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes, the comma, 15, from the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, in this case, I removed the 15. Let's save my change and refresh 
the browser screen and notice that I get not a number showing up on the 
browser window.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Functions. Final price is, Not a number, abbreviated as, N A N.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, that's telling me that something went wrong. So, in order to find
 out what happened, let's do a console, console.log. And I want to find 
out what happened to pcMarkup in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The 
code is: console, dot, log, open curved bracket, p c mark up, close 
curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'll save these changes. So I entered a brand new line, on line 
13, console.log pcMarkup. And let's refresh our browser screen. I just 
tell get NaN, but if I hit F12 on the keyboard, what we're seeing is 
that something is undefined.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Functions. Final price, is, NaN. He clicks, the F12 button on the
 keyboard, a developer console window opens up. Following text with a 
number is displayed: 139697, dot, html, colon, 13 is undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, and it's on line 13. So we know that pcMarkup in this case is 
undefined. So it's never a good idea to especially where calculations 
are involved to pass in less arguments than what's required by the 
function. So I'm going to put a comment on line 13 to not have that 
happened. And on the browser screen, I'll hit F12 for a second time to 
get rid of the developer tools.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, slash, slash, before console
 on code line 13, and he clicks, the F12 button again on the keyboard, 
to hide the developer console window.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the HTML document, I'm going to put back in my 15%. But I'm also going to pass in yet another parameter, 25 in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, comma, 15, comma 25 on code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, I'm passing into a function that requires two parameters and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, price, comma, p c mark up on code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>parsing in three instead.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, comma, 25, from the code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what's going to happen to that 25? Well, let's save the changes, 
refresh the screen and you'll notice that we're back to the original 
number that we had before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. After saving the file, text changes on the 
screen: Java Script Functions. Final price is, 3 point 2 7 7 5.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So 15% of 285 added to 285 will give us 3.2775. What happened to the 
third argument is that it was simply ignored by the function. But I did 
say that the functions behave just like in other programming languages, 
but JavaScript does have a few tricks up it's sleeve. So there in the 
background, there's actually something called the arguments, 
arguments.length parameter. And we can access it in this way, 
arguments.length.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He removes, slash, slash, before 
console &amp; replace arguments, dot length, in place of p c mark up in 
the code line 13. Now the code is: console, dot, log, open curved 
bracket, arguments, dot length, close curved bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on my console window, I want to see what the arguments.length is. Now, I know that I'm expecting two parameters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, price, comma, p c mark up on code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the screen, hit F12 on the keyboard, and notice that we get three.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. After saving the file, following text 
doesn't change on the screen: Java Script Functions. Final price is, 3 
point 2 7 7 5. He clicks, the F12 button on the keyboard, a developer 
console window opens up. Following text with a number is displayed: 3, 
139697, dot, html, colon, 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So JavaScript knows that there was an extra parameter that was passed in to this percentPlus function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 25 in the code line 18 &amp; percent plus in the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll hit F12 again on the browser to get rid of the developer tools.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks, the F12 button again on the keyboard, to hide the developer console window.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And to take this example a little bit further, JavaScript does have 
something called a rest parameter and it happens in the function 
declaration.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So next to markup, if I put a comma there and then I put three dots 
like this, I notice it looks kind of weird. And then I put some kind of a
 variable name like arg in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, comma, dot, dot, dot, args, after p c mark up in the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then, it means that, that 25 will now be captured in the args parameter.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 25 from the code line 18 &amp;, dot dot dot, args, from the code line12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And in order to see that, I could show it on the log. So args., actually it's just args.length.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, arguments, dot, length with args, dot, length, in the code line13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save these changes, refresh the browser screen, I still get my 3.225 so nothing has changed there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. After saving the file, following text 
doesn't change on the screen: Java Script Functions. Final price is, 3, 
dot, 2775.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But if I hit F12 on the keyboard, what we're going to get is an 
argument, is a number one. So it means that args.length is showing me 
that I have a one.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He clicks, the F12 button on the 
keyboard, a developer console window opens up. Following text with a 
number is displayed: 1, 139697, dot, html, colon, 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if we added another parameter there, save those changes, refresh the browser screen, now we get two.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds, comma, 33, after 25 on code 
line 18. He saves the codes in notepad++ file, and refreshes the 
browser. After saving the file, following text doesn't change on the 
screen: Java Script Functions. Final price is, 3 point 2 7 7 5. On 
developer console window, following text with a number is displayed: 2, 
139697, dot, html, colon, 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So anything to the right of the initial two arguments that the function requests will be stored in arguments.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, from the code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if you ever wanted to access those values, you would simply 
access it, like any other array. Now, args is not a true array, it is an
 array like object. So, if I were to access the second parameter of that
 array, I should be accessing the 33.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, args, dot, length with 
args, open square bracket, 1, close square bracket, in the code line 13.
 He highlights, 33, from the code line 18.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save our changes, refresh the browser screen, notice that I get my 33.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script Functions. Final price is, 3 point 2 7 7 5. On developer console 
window, following text with a number is displayed: 33, 139697, dot, 
html, colon, 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So functions behave just like in other languages, but JavaScript does have a few little tricks up it's sleeve.</p></div>

Function Arguments and Values
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Functions Arguments and Values Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to discuss JavaScript functions and 
to look at functions and passing those functions as values. We'll also 
take a look at function arguments and we'll also discuss anonymous 
functions in JavaScript. On the screen, we have two applications opened 
up, Notepad++ on the left and the Chrome on the right. The Notepad++ 
document has an HTML document opened up with JavaScript in the body tag 
of that HTML document. On the right is Chrome, rendering the document 
that you see on the left. Now you may have seen this example before, 
where we are calling a function called percentPlus, which is going to 
calculate the markup on a price and return the price plus the markup to 
us. The name of the function is percentPlus it takes two parameters. And
 I'm calling that percentPlus function on line 17. I'm calling it by 
name, and I'm passing it the two required parameters, as you can see.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on the line 17 is, double quote,
 Final price is, double quote, + percent plus, open curved bracket, 2 
point, 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now I'm calling the function directly within the printing part of 
this particular program. However, it is also possible to assign a 
variable. So I could do something like this, let, let's say pc = 
percentPlus. And I can call the function on line 16, so I'm inserting a 
line on line 16. I am passing in my two arguments, and so the result of 
the call to this function will be stored in a variable called pc.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts a code line 
after line 15. Each code line below shifts one line downward. The new 
code on code line 16 is, let PC = percentPlus, open curved bracket, 2 
point 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can then copy that pc and put it where I had my function call before within the line that brings it to the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He copies PC from line 16, and paste 
it on line 18, replacing, percent plus, open curved bracket, 2 point, 8 
5, comma, 15, close curved bracket. The new code on line 18 is, double 
quote, Final price is, double quote, + PC, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in line 18, I set a final price being a function call, it is now a
 variable. So final price is a variable called pc. If I save these 
changes, refresh the browser screen, you notice that nothing happens. So
 we simply replaced the function in the printout to the document, to the
 browser screen by a variable. And that variable is calling the function
 instead.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights PC , and then, percent 
plus, open curved bracket, 2 point, 8 5, comma, 15, close curved 
bracket, in the code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering, we could just declare functions like this and use it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is referring to the 
code lines from 11 to 18. Code on the line 11 is, let p 1 = document, 
dot, get element by ID, open curved bracket, double quote, p 1, double 
quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code on the line 12 is, 
function percentplus, open curved bracket, price, comma, PC markup, 
close curved bracket, open curly bracket. Code on the line 13 is let 
mark up = price, multiplied by, open curved bracket, PC markup, divided 
by, 100, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code on line 14 is, return 
price, + markup, semi-colon. Code on line 15 is, close curly bracket, 
semi-colon. Code on line 16 is, let PC = percentplus, open curved 
bracket, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code 
on line 17 is p 1, dot, inner HTML +=. Code on line 18 is, double quote,
 Final price is, double quote, comma, + PC, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But normally, a function would belong to some kind of object. Well in
 JavaScript, even though we don’t use it, functions do belong to the 
global object, which in this case is the window object. So on line 16 if
 I were to insert the parent object, which is window in this case. So 
instead of calling percentPlus, I'm calling window.percentPlus. I save 
these changes, refresh my browser screen, notice that nothing happens. 
So that proves that percentPlus, the function that we just wrote, 
belongs to the window object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code lines 12 to 15 and he also highlights window, in code line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if I did not return price.markup, but returned 
this keyword instead. And this, by using this, I'm using it like a 
personal pronoun. I'm saying, return the object that owns this function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies code line 14 to, return this, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I save these changes, refresh the browser screen, you will notice 
that we do get object Window being returned. So once again, that proves 
that our function belongs to the Window object. I'm going to remove this
 keyword, replace the price + markup that we had before. And remove 
window from line 16 so that our application is back to the way it was 
before. Save these changes, refresh the browser screen, notice that 
we're back to the 3.2775. Now this function declared on line 12, it has a
 name, it's called percentPlus. And I can use that name anywhere I want 
in this HTML document wherever I have JavaScript. But it is also 
possible to declare and use functions without giving them a name. In 
that case, we say the function is an anonymous function. So let's see 
how we can take this current function and turn it into an anonymous 
function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter makes changes in code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Well first of all, I'll have to declare a variable to hold the return
 of that function. So I can say, let finalPrice = function, and I remove
 the name percentPlus, I don't need that name any more. So now I don't 
have a name. But I do have a variable. So I can copy that variable from 
line 12 and put it on line 16. Replace the name of the function with the
 name of the variable in this case. If I save these changes, I refresh 
the browser screen, notice that I still have my price. So I have just 
turned a named function into an anonymous function.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="e84f6f20-73a8-11e8-82d9-bf3deb09ab23">
Recursive Functions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Recursive Functions Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about recursive functions in
 JavaScript. On the screen, I have two applications opened up. On the 
left is Notepad++ pointing to a simple short HTML file. On the right 
side is a Chrome browser that is rendering the file that you see on the 
left. The file on the left has some JavaScript between lines 10 and 18.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on the line 10 is, open angle 
bracket, script, close angle bracket. Code on the line 11 is, let p 1 = 
document, dot, get element by ID, open curved bracket, double quote, p 
1, double quote, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code on the line 12 
is, function final price, open curved bracket, price, comma, PC markup, 
close curved bracket, open curly bracket. Code on the line 13 is let 
mark up = price, multiplied by, open curved bracket, PC markup, divided 
by, 100, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code on line 14 is, return 
price, + markup, semi-colon. Code on line 15 is, close curly bracket, 
semi-colon. Code on line 16 is p 1, dot, inner HTML +=. Code on line 17 
is, double quote, Final price is, double quote, comma, + final price, 
open curved bracket, 100, comma, 10, close curved bracket, semi-colon. 
Code on the line 18 is, open angle bracket, forward slash, script, close
 angle bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we see a function being declared on lines 12. And we are calling 
that function on line 17. Recursion is when a function calls itself. It 
is mainly used in sorting situations and in any type of fractal 
situation. By that I mean, we start with some whole number, and 
iteratively reduce that whole by some fraction until we get some kind of
 desired result. So what this means is that in a mathematical problem 
like finding the factorial of a number, a recursive function would be 
ideal for that. Now another advantage to using a recursive function is 
that in some situations, it might reduce the amount of variables that we
 need to declare and use. In other cases, some clever techniques can be 
used to take advantage of the call stack, but that's an advanced topic. 
Having said all of that too, I will say that just about anything that 
could be done with a recursive function can be done with a loop.</p>
<p>And in some cases, it's much simpler to use a loop. Let's take a look
 at the application we have or the script that we have in the HTML 
document on the left. We have seen this before in some other videos, but
 I have a function declared on line 12. And I'm calling that function on
 line 17. In this case, we just wanted to see what would happen if we 
apply the 10% to 100 and then return the amount that we sent in, plus 
the percentage markup. So it's almost like saying something cost a $100,
 we wanted to see what 10% effect on that 100 would be. Of course, it's 
going to be 110, and we see the final price in the browser window. So in
 order for me to make this final price function a recursive function, 
all I really have to do is change line 14. So instead of returning the 
price + markup, I return the function name instead.</p>
<p>So I replaced price plus the markup by the function name. And just 
that change alone will make this function a recursive function. Now, I'm
 not going to run the function because this is just going to keep 
calling itself forever, and we'll have a browser crash at the right 
side. So I'm not going to do that. I'm just showing you that in order to
 make this final price a recursive function, I would simply have to call
 finalPrice again before I return from the function. So line 14 will 
actually behave like a go-to statement, so it will go to line 12 each 
and every time. And that would happen until we do a Ctrl+All+Delete or 
something like that and stop the browser from running. So what we need 
to do is figure out a way to stop this recursive calls. We need to be 
able to stop it from getting into an endless loop or an infinite loop. 
But taking the example that I have on the screen, we could actually make
 it a little bit more functional. In that, I will have to restructure 
the function itself. But we might see something a little bit more useful
 on the browser screen. What I'm going to do is I'm going to cut lines 
16 and 17 by using Ctrl+X on the keyboard after highlighting it. And I'm
 going to reposition those lines above the return statement. So all I 
did was remove the printing part of this application and put it above 
the finalPrice.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have to find another way to call the function 
itself, so I am going to copy the name of the function and call that 
function from beneath the function. So recalling the function again, 
just like we did before with the $100, and let's say, 10% in this case. 
At my return statement, I'm going to call again the price. Now price is 
already declared once the first call is made. Price is already 
initialized. So I have price, but my pcMarkup, I am going to reduce that
 by one. Then I'm going to restructure the printing part that goes to 
the browser, so I need to make some changes, so I am going to actually 
use templated strings here. So I am going to say, At a markup of, and 
this is my pcMarkup, At a markup of that, it's a templated string, so I 
don't need this anymore, the final price is, Here's my other template. 
And this is going to be markup. And I'm just going to stick a break in 
here. Now I'm going to wrap everything up in those backticks so that I 
create a templated string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 15 and splits it in two lines. The new code on line 15 is, accent, 
At a markup of dollar sign, open curly bracket, PC markup, close curly 
bracket. The new code on line 16 is, the final price is dollar sign, 
open curly bracket, PC markup, close curly bracket, open angle bracket, b
 r, forward slash, close angle bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now remember, I said we have to find a way of stopping the endless 
loop. So we do that by declaring or using an if statement. So I can say 
if, and here I'm going to say pcMarkup is greater than 1. And only if 
it's greater than 1, because I know at some point in time by reducing 
pcMarkup by 1 each time we call the function by reducing pcMarkup. 
Eventually, it's going to go from to ten, to nine, to eight, etc., and 
at some point in time, it's going to become zero. And at that point, 
that's when I want to jump out of this loop and continue on with the 
rest of the program. Well, there's nothing here. But let's save these 
changes, return to the browser screen, refresh that browser screen. And 
here, we see now a little bit of more information when it comes to using
 recursion.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The text on the browser is, Java 
Script Functions Recursion, At a markup of 10, the final price is 10, At
 a markup of 9, the final price is 9, At a markup of 8, the final price 
is 8, At a markup of 7, the final price is 7 point 14 times 0, 1, At a 
markup of 6, the final price is 6, At a markup of 5, the final price is 
5, At a markup of 4, the final price is 4, At a markup of 3, the final 
price is 3, At a markup of 2, the final price is 2, At a markup of 1, 
the final price is 1.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Well, I do need to add the price back at some point in time. I can do
 it at line 13, or I can do it where I print the markup. So let's see, 
price + markup, save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and now 
we see a lot better information.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After making the changes, the new 
text on the browser is, Java Script Functions Recursion, At a markup of 
10, the final price is 110, At a markup of 9, the final price is 109, At
 a markup of 8, the final price is 108, At a markup of 7, the final 
price is 107, At a markup of 6, the final price is 106, At a markup of 
5, the final price is 105, At a markup of 4, the final price is 104, At a
 markup of 3, the final price is 103, At a markup of 2, the final price 
is 102, At a markup of 1, the final price is 101.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So recursion is possible in JavaScript, just be careful how you use it.</p></div>

Scoping
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Scoping Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about global versus local 
variables in JavaScript. What you're seeing in front of you are two 
applications. The application on the left, Notepad++, it is opened up to
 an HTML file. And if you notice, there is some JavaScript between lines
 10 and 19. On the right of your screen is a Chrome browser. And that 
Chrome browser is rendering that file that you see on the left of your 
screen. We are going to focus on the script tags or the code between the
 script tags. If you notice, we have a function being declared on line 
12 and that function has been called on line 16.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on line 12 is, function final 
price, open curved bracket, price, comma, markup, close curved bracket, 
open curly bracket. Code on line 16 is, var PC = final price, open 
curved bracket, 2 point 8 5, comma, 15, close curved bracket, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But this demo is about global versus local scope. And when we talk 
about scope, we're talking about variables. So the good news is that in 
JavaScript, a variable is determined by where that variable is declared 
and used. And the other good news is that JavaScript really only has two
 scopes, well, at least until ES6. Now after ES6, we have a third scope 
which is called block scope. I have discussed block scope and 
demonstrated block scopes in other videos. So I'm going to keep this 
discussion to global versus local variables. Also notice that I have 
changed the let keyword to the var keyword, because let keyword would 
lead us into a discussion about block scopes. So we've got our function 
and a variable declared inside of a function belongs to that function. 
And it has its own scope within that function, meaning that any variable
 declared within a function is really only accessible from that 
function. So, if we take a look at the example again, we do have a 
variable declared on line 13, its called markup. That variable is really
 only available within that function. So that means that if I tried to 
print that variable, it will work. So for example, I'm going to copy 
some code from lines 17 and 18.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Code on line 17 is, p 1, dot, inner HTML +=, Code on line 18 is, double quote, Final price is, double quote, + PC, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to copy that code, and I'm going to place it just before the return statement there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The return statement is initially on line 16. Code on the return statement is, return, price + markup, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And let's take a look at what will happen. So what I want to say for 
this is that I want to show what markup is. So I'm going to say, markup 
is whatever markup is. And I'm going to copy the variable markup and I'm
 going to replace it with pc in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 15. The new code is, double quote, markup is, double quote, +, markup, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've just inserted a couple of lines between lines 14 and 15. I 
want to print markup to the browser screen. So if I save this change, 
refresh the browser screen, I do see my markup there. Well, of course we
 can make it a little bit prettier by inserting</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new text on the browser is, Java Script Global versus Local variables, Markup is 0.4 2 7 5, Final price is 3.2 7 7 5</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>a break tag here, so I can do something like this. Insert my break tags right here, save the changes, refresh the screen, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 15. The 
new code is, double quote, markup is, double quote, +, markup, +, double
 quote, open angle bracket, b r, forward slash, close angle bracket, 
double quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>now we see that markup is showing. However, if I were to take the 
exact same lines, so I'm copying the exact same lines from lines 14 and 
15, and I am placing it beneath okay, so I did not copy it. Let's try 
copying that again, so, I'm going to copy lines 14 and 15. Copy that and
 place it just before the ending script tag. And I just wanted to see 
what would happen now. So, if I save my changes, well, actually let's 
remove the lines 14 and 15, because I've already copied it to line 19 
and 20 now. Save those changes, refresh the browser screen. Notice that 
something is missing.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new text on the browser is, Java Script Global versus Local variables, Final price is 3.2 7 7 5</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I don't even see the string that I'm supposed to be printing here. If
 I hit F12 on the keyboard, we will see that something's not defined and
 it's on line 20. So, markup in this case is not defined. This means 
then that markup is really only available to the function final price. 
So, that's your local scope. If you take a look at p1, p1 was declared 
outside of the function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights code lines 12 to 15. 
Code on line 12 is, function final price, open curved bracket, price, 
comma, PC markup, close curved bracket, open curly bracket. Code on the 
line 13 is var mark up = price, multiplied by, open curved bracket, PC 
markup, divided by, 100, close curved bracket, semi-colon. Code on line 
14 is, return price, + markup, semi-colon. Code on line 15 is, close 
curly bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So p1 actually belongs to the window object and that's why I can use 
p1 on line 17. So p1 being declared outside of a function is in the 
global scope. So that's the difference between global and local.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 id="ed792680-73a8-11e8-82d9-bf3deb09ab23">
Arrow Functions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Arrow Functions. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about arrow functions in 
JavaScript. On the screen, we have an HTML document on the left side of 
your screen. That HTML document is being rendered on the right side of 
your screen in a Chrome browser. Now, you may have seen me use this 
example before, and that's good because we can see a progression here. 
On the left side, between the lines 10 and 23 on the HTML document, 
there's the JavaScript, and that JavaScript is being rendered in your 
Chrome browser to the right. In the JavaScript, we have a function, 
starting on line 13 being declared, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: function, 
final price, open curve bracket, price, comma, p c mark up, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we have a call to that function on line 18.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 18 is: var, p c, =, final price, open curve bracket, 2.85, comma, 15, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Basically, what we're trying to do is try to figure out what 15% of 
2.85 is, but the return that we want is the entire number. So 2.85 times
 15% added back to 2.85 will give us $3.28, as you see on the right side
 of your screen. Now, if you've ever heard of lambda expressions in 
other languages, then arrow functions behave just like lambda 
expressions. It helps us to reduce the amount of lines that our function
 uses. In fact, they help us to eliminate the function keyword itself. 
In some cases, you can even eliminate the return keyword, and in other 
cases, we can eliminate the curly braces. So they help us make our 
functions more concise. I'm going to start by replacing the function 
that starts on line 13, ends on line 16, by a new arrow type function in
 JavaScript.</p>
<p>So I'm going to start by saying, let's allow or let's create a 
variable called finalPrice, and make that equal to something. Now, after
 the equal sign, I do have parentheses, and that's going to work exactly
 like the function definition on line 13. We are going to pass our 
parameters into that by using those parenthesis, so let finalPrice equal
 to price and markup, and after the parenthesis is where we're going to 
put our arrow function. After the arrow functions have inserted some 
curly braces, so we're going to keep those for now. Then inside of the 
curly braces is where you're going to start writing your function body. 
So we need to return the price times the markup divided by 100, and then
 add it back to the price again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds a new line of code
 on line 17. The code here is: let final price, =, open curve bracket, 
price, comma, p c mark up, close curve bracket, arrow function, open 
curly bracket, return price, multiplied by, open curve bracket, p c mark
 up, divided by 100, close curve bracket, + price, close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just that one line, we now have a new function. So I can get 
rid off the old function on line 13. Okay, so I'm going to get rid of 
that, actually just one second. So we got rid of the function on line 
13.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He deletes the codes from line 13 to 16. The code on line 17 is now the code on line 14. The code on line 18 is now on line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to save those changes, and I'll refresh the browser screen,
 and notice that nothing happens, that means that our function is 
working. Now, the function is sort of going over to the right side, and I
 did say that we can shorten our functions using arrow functions, our 
traditional functions using arrow functions. But in this case, let's 
leave it like it is. And because it's still on one line, but it's sort 
of like running off the right side the page, you could, if you wanted 
to, make some changes and create it just like you would a normal 
function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He splits the code on line 14 into 
three parts. Now the code on line 14 is: let final price, =, open curve 
bracket, price, comma, p c mark up, close curve bracket, arrow function,
 open curly bracket. The code on line 15 is: return price, multiplied 
by, open curve bracket, p c mark up, divided by 100, close curve 
bracket, + price The code on line 16 is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if you notice, I've allowed it to run over three lines here. So 
I'll save those changes, refresh the browser screen, and nothing 
happens, we still have our original price. So basically, what I did was,
 I put the function body between the curly braces, but I made sure that 
those two curly braces were on separate lines. It makes the code a 
little bit easier to read. But let's see if we can take it a little bit 
further. Take a look at price and pcMarkup. What if we were to use our 
documentation to explain what I'm about to do? So let's replace price 
with just one letter, x. So that means that wherever I use the word 
price, I can replace price with x.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the codes on line 14 and 15, the presenter replaces price with x</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I can do the same thing with pcMarkup, I can replace pcMarkup with a y. And then, wherever I see pcMarkup, I use a y.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the codes on line 14 and 15, the presenter replaces p c mark up with y</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have just replaced price and markup, those words, with just x 
and y. Now, like I said, we would have to document this somewhere. If I 
refresh the screen, notice nothing happens, we still are at 3.2775. But 
it means now that we could probably try to put everything back on one 
line, and notice that it fits nicely on one line.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He places the codes on line 14, 15 
and 16 in one line, on line 14. Now the new code on line 14 is: let 
final price, =, open curve bracket, x, comma, y, close curve bracket, 
arrow function, open curly bracket, return x, multiplied by, open curve 
bracket, y, divided by 100, close curve bracket, + x, close curly 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can now save my changes, refresh my browser, notice that nothing 
happens. But you know what, what if we always knew that our percentage 
markup is going to be 15, what if that never changes? It means then, 
that we can probably insert a constant variable into our code, call it 
markup. So I've declared on line 11, a markup constant of 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new line of code on line 11. The code here is: const, mark up, = 15, semi colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So then, that means that we can, if we wanted to, replace our y with 
markup. Wherever we had y before, we can replace it with markup. But 
also, notice that we don't need the y-parameter anymore. So I can get 
rid of my y-parameter and just leave an x. And if I did that, then I 
don't need the parenthesis anymore. Also, because I now have just one 
short, simple expression, I don't need the return statement anymore, and
 I don't need those curly braces anymore. So here we are on line 14, the
 function that took about four or</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 14. The 
new code here is: let final price, =, x, arrow function, x, multiplied 
by, open curve bracket, mark up, divided by 100, close curve bracket, + 
x, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>five lines before has now been reduced to just one line. Let's save our changes, refresh the screen, refresh the browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result from the browser disappears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Okay, so I think I did not use the right word here, so it's markup, 
not only that, I don't need to pass the 15 on line 16 anymore.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He changes the u from lower case to upper case in mark up in the code on line 14. He removes comma 15 from the code on line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I could just pass the 2.85 or whatever the cost is of the item. I can
 save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and notice that we 
still have 3.2775. So the function is working exactly like what we had 
when we started, except that everything is now on one single, straight 
line. So using arrow functions in JavaScript might get a little bit, you
 might need some time to adjust to using the function because it looks 
weird at first. But it does have some good uses in terms of whenever you
 need to manipulate a raise and things like that. Or another advanced 
topic is whenever we deal with promises and callbacks, those arrow 
functions are useful in those situations.</p></div>

Predefined Functions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Pre-defined Functions. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about built in functions in 
JavaScript. These are the predefined functions that come with the 
language itself. On the screen, we have Notepad++ opened up to a short 
HTML file. On the right side, we see a Chrome browser rendering the file
 that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The browser on the right side of the 
screen displays the results of the notepad file on the left. And 
currently, it is showing: JavaScript Pre, hyphen Defined Functions</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That HTML file has some script tags and we'll be using the area 
between the script tags to write our various methods. Now, the function 
or the browser only understands strings. No other data type can be 
interpreted by the browser. We, as developers need to either implicitly 
or explicitly turn our data types into a string that the browser will 
then print on the browser's surface. So string functions are important, 
and the typical ones are available in JavaScript, just like in most 
other languages.</p>
<p>Things like toLowerCase, toUpperCase, split, and slice, and as well 
as substrings and finding the index of a particular character, etc. But 
since ES6, an interesting method of the string object, if you want to 
think of string as an object, is the raw method. Now with raw, it won't 
work with a browser or the browser surface because with raw, it does not
 really handle HTML well. Also with raw, it works with templated 
strings. So I'm going to use the console to demonstrate what raw looks 
like. I'm going to insert a piece of code at line 14.</p>
<p>And I'm going to save the changes and let's see what this looks like 
in the console window. So I'm saying console.log, there's a templated 
string that has a \n and a \t in it. Now overtime, most developers would
 understand \n will simply put the rest of the characters on a second 
line. \t will move it over the tab space, whatever the tab space happens
 to be in that environment. And there are a number of other non-printing
 characters like this. Let's save this change, refresh the browser 
screen. We won't see anything on the browser surface, but if I hit F12 
on the keyboard, get into the console window. We will see that Hello 
Skillsoft was printed exactly as we told it to.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter inserts an empty line 
of code below lines 13 and inputs the following code in it: console dot 
log, open curved bracket, accent, hello backslash N backslash T skill 
soft, accent, close curve bracket semi colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, if I were to apply the raw method here. So if I do something like this, now believe it or</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter changes the code in 
line 14 from: console dot log, open curved bracket, accent, hello 
backslash N backslash T skill soft, accent, close curve bracket semi 
colon. To: console dot log, open curved bracket, string dot raw, accent,
 hello backslash N backslash T skill soft, accent, close curve bracket 
semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>not, this raw method does not use parentheses. Also as I mentioned 
before, it only works with templated strings at this point in time. If I
 save this change, refresh the browser screen, notice what happens. It 
actually prints the raw string. I'm going to to hit F12 on the keyboard 
to get rid of the developer tools and I'm going to remove my line 14 
where I showed the raw method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter deletes line 14</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's move on now to array functions. Now, I did use array functions 
before in some of my previous videos, but I wanted to talk about an 
interesting array method called some. Now, most of these methods use a 
callback function. And in order to use some, I will have to write a 
callback function. Now what some will do is it will take your function, 
your custom function, and apply that to each element of the array. That 
function is supposed to return true or false. So some will tell us 
whether that array is true or false based on your function. Let's look 
at an example. I'm going to prepare a function, this is a custom 
function that is going to take some value and divide it by 3. And if the
 remainder is equal to 0, it means that, that value is divisible by 3.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter inserts three empty 
lines of code below line 15 and inputs the following code in: Line 16: 
function d i v by three, open curved bracket, value comma i d x comma a r
 g s close curve bracket, open curly bracket. Line 17: if open curve 
bracket value percent three triple equals sign zero close curve bracket,
 return true, semi colon. Line 18: close curly bracket</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's also create an array of numbers and I'm going to place my array
 underneath the function. And then finally, I'm going to call the some 
method. So I'm going to say create another variable, called let three. 
And I'm going to make that equal to, well I am going to invoke the some 
method and pass it the callback function, which is divBythree.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter inserts two empty lines
 of code below line 18 and inputs the following code in: Line 19: let 
nums equals open square bracket sixty two comma one fifty one comma four
 comma thirty three comma eleven comma forty three close square bracket,
 semi colon. Line 20: let by three equals nums dot some open curve 
bracket div by three close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So basically, what some is going to do is it's going to apply this 
function, divBythree against each of these elements of the array. Now, 
when it gets to 33, it's going to get a remainder of 0 and it's going to
 return true. And therefore, the entire nums.some will return true, so 
byThree should have the value of true in it. In order to see our value, 
we will print it to the browser screen in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter inserts an empty line 
of code below line 20 and inputs the following code in the empty line: p
 1 dot inner H T M L plus equals by three semi colon</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes. I will refresh the browser screen and we
 do see true because 33 is divisible by three. But if I remove this, 
notice that none of the other numbers are divisible by three. If I save 
my changes, refresh the browser screen, we now get false. So it means 
then that some is working properly. Now I'm going to remove the code 
that I just wrote in here, so we can move on to the date functions.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter deletes lines 16 to 21</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now just about every language has date functions. Date is something 
that is universal, so every language has to have it. So on line 18, I 
inserted some code where I am creating a new date object called myDate.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes a code on line 18. The code is, let my Date = new Date, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What I'm trying to do is date arithmetic in JavaScript. So I'm going 
to create another date called inSevenDays. So basically what I'm going 
to try to do is add seven days to today's date.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes a code on line 19. The code is, let in seven days = new Date, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So inSevenDays, what I want to do now is use that inSevenDays and use
 the setDate function of the date object called inSevenDays. Use the 
myDate object that I had on from line 18 and then, I'm going to use the 
getDate on myDate. So it will return today's date, it will add 7 to it 
and then that will be stored in the new inSevenDays object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes code on line 20. The code 
is, in seven days, dot, set date, open curve bracket, my Date, dot, get 
date, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, + 7, close curve bracket,
 semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now in order to see all of this happening, I would have to print 
everything out to the browser screen. So I'm going to use my paragraph 
tag again.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter writes a 3 line code, 
the code on line 21 is, p1, dot, inner HTML, += the code on line 22 is, 
accent, today is, $ sign, open curly bracket, my date, close curly 
bracket, but, in 7 days, it will be The code on line 23 is, $ sign, open
 curly bracket, in seven days, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So there's our first date, that's today's date. But in seven days, it
 will be inSevenDays. Remember, inSevenDays, we will be setting a new 
date of today's date added to seven. Once I have all this code complete,
 I will save my changes, refresh the browser screen. Notice it says, 
today is June 13th. But in seven days, it's going to be June 20th.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The changed text on the chrome 
browser is, Today is Wed, Jun, 13, 2018, 11: 50: 35 GMT-0300 (Atlantic 
Daylight Time) but in 7 days, it will be, Wed, Jun, 20, 2018, 11: 50: 35
 GMT-0300 (Atlantic Daylight Time)</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's how the date arithmetic works in JavaScript. Again, I'm 
going to remove the code that I wrote, and so we can move on to some 
math functions.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter removes the code from lines 18 to 23.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I think most languages have math functions, it's again one of those 
universal things. And so there's really nothing new here, I'm going to 
insert some code that uses the pow function or the power function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts a 3 line code below line 
19. Code on line 20 is, P1, dot, inner HTML, += Code on line 21 is, 
accent, 4 raised to the power of 2 code on the line 22 is, is $ sign, 
open curly bracket, Math, dot, pow, open curve bracket, 4, comma, 2, 
close curve bracket, close curly bracket, period, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So here we're seeing that we're going to take 4 and raise it to the 
power of 2. So it is as simple as Math.pow, the first number is the 
number that we're working with. The second parameter is the power that 
we're raising the first parameter to. So 4 will be raised to 2, let's 
save these changes, refresh the browser screen and now we see that it is
 16.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The changed text on the chrome browser is, 4 raised to the power of 2 is 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now what is interesting though are the HTML, some of the HTML 
functions or the html wrappers. Let me remove the code that I had from 
before and under html wrappers,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter removes the code from lines 20 to 22.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to insert the same function that we had before concerning date.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts a 3 line code below line 
21. The code on line 22 is, let my Date = new Date, open curve bracket, 
close curve bracket, semi-colon. The code on line 23 is, let in seven 
days = new Date, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi-colon. 
The code on line 24 is, in seven days, dot, set date, open curve 
bracket, my Date, dot, get date, open curve bracket, close curve 
bracket, + 7, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I'm going to use the same date. Remember, we had an initial date. 
We added 7 to that date and we have a new date now. So if you remember, 
we did have some code before that printed out the new date.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter writes a 3 line code 
below line 24, the code on line 25 is, p1, dot, inner HTML, += the code 
on line 26 is, accent, today is, $ sign, open curly bracket, my date, 
close curly bracket, but, in 7 days, it will be The code on line 27 is, $
 sign, open curly bracket, in seven days, close curly bracket, accent, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So if I save these changes, refresh the browser screen, we do see 
that it works just like the example from before. We added 7 to 13, so we
 have a new date of June 20th.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The changed text on the chrome 
browser is, Today is Wed, Jun, 13, 2018, 11: 53: 13 GMT-0300 (Atlantic 
Daylight Time) but in 7 days, it will be, Wed, Jun, 20, 2018, 11: 53: 13
 GMT-0300 (Atlantic Daylight Time)</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What's interesting about the html wrappers is that, we can take data 
that's going to be portrayed, or pushed through the browser screen, and 
do things with it very quickly. But in order to do that, I would have to
 first of all convert the inSevenDays to string. So I would have to say 
toString, first of all to convert my date toString explicitly. And then 
if I wanted to, I can use one of these wrappers, so for example I can 
make my new date bolded.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modified the code on line 27, he 
new code is, $ sign, open curly bracket, in seven days, dot, to string, 
open curve bracket, close curve bracket, dot, bold, open curve bracket, 
close curve bracket, close curly bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just these simple changes, let's save those changes, refresh
 the browser screen and there we have a bolded second part of this 
templated string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the chrome browser, following text becomes bold: Wed, Jun, 20, 2018, 11: 54: 08 GMT-0300 (Atlantic Daylight Time)</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's the way you would use html wrappers in JavaScript. So there
 are a lot more methods but of course, there are too many to put into 
one video.</p></div>

Creating Custom Objects
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Creating Custom Objects. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about JavaScript objects. On
 the left side of the screen is an HTML document opened up in Notepad++.
 On the right side of the screen is a Chrome browser that is rendering 
the page that you see on the left side of your screen. The HTML document
 on the left of your screen has JavaScript code embedded between lines 
11 and 23. So this demo is about object oriented programming. And 
JavaScript, believe it or not, even though we don't think of it that way
 is object oriented.</p>
<p>We can do encapsulation, aggregation, inheritance and polymorphism. 
As a matter of fact, since ES 6 they introduced the class keyword. To 
sort of simulate classes as they appear in Java and C#, C++ etc. Keep in
 mind though, in JavaScipt using a class keyword is just a special 
function. So throughout this series, I will continue to use the 
traditional way of creating the classes with the function keyword. And 
I'm also doing it for backwards compatibility. The example on the screen
 may have been shown in another video, but if we take a look at it, we 
do have a vehicle object that is being declared on line 13.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: let vehicle, =, open curly bracket</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That object, that vehicle object, has properties like make, color, 
year. And it also has a method called aboutMe() that simply returns all 
of the properties concatenated together. So this is as simple as you 
get. On line 22, you see me accessing the vehicle object and actually</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 22 is: p 1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, accent, $ sign, open curve bracket, vehicle, dot, about 
me, open close curve bracket, close curly bracket, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>accessing the method code aboutMe(), which will return a string in 
this case. And as you can see on the right side of your screen, that 
browser window is showing us the aboutMe() method converted into a 
string.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The string showing on the browser is, Buick, Red, 2019</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So there's really nothing special about an object in JavaScript. Just
 keep in mind that if we declare variables normally, like on line 12, 
where we've just declared a p1 variable, and that</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: let p1, =, 
document dot, get element, by I d, open curve bracket, double quote, P 
1, double quote, Close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>p1 variable belongs to the global object, which is the window, in 
this case. However, on line 13, we've declared a vehicle object. And 
everything inside that object that uses the this operator, or this 
keyword, is actually talking about or accessing the vehicle's 
properties, etc. Whatever belongs to the vehicle, this within that 
function definition, will refer to the custom object that we just 
created. So let's make the object a little bit more interesting.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to line 17, the 
code here is, this, dot, color, +, double quote, double quote, +. He 
highlights, this in the code. He also highlights vehicle in the code on 
line 13.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's put in maybe a cost, cost of let's say $10,000. I'll have to use another comma here.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter goes to the line 14, 
the code here is, make, colon, open quote Buick, close quote, comma, 
color, colon, open quote, red, close quote, comma, year, colon, 2019, 
comma. He adds cost, colon, 10000, comma, at the end of the code on line
 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to create another function that will work with that 
cost. So let's say we call it costPlusTax(). Now, once I have my 
function declared, I can then, or method declared, I can then try to 
calculate out the cost plus tax. Let's use a 10% tax in this case. So I 
can say return, return, let's see, cost. Now I'm doing this 
deliberately, but just to prove a point. Cost plus, and we will have to 
work out whatever the tax rate is. So in this case it is (cost * .09), 
so 9%. Now all I need to do in order to access this</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds two new lines of code below 
line 19. the new code on line 20 is: cost plus tax, open close curve 
brackets, open curly bracket. the new code on line 21 is: return cost, 
+, open curve brackets, cost, multiplied by, .09, close curve bracket, 
semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>method is simply call it somewhere inside of my code. So let's call 
it on line 25 where we're printing it. Now remember, I said I'm doing</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 25 is p 1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, accent, $ sign, open curly bracket, vehicle, dot, about 
Me, open close curve brackets, close curly bracket, accent, semi colon. 
The presenter replaces about Me by cost plus tax The new code on line 25
 is p 1, dot, inner HTML, =, accent, $ sign, open curly bracket, 
vehicle, dot, cost plus tax, open close curve bracket, close curly 
bracket, accent, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>something deliberately. I'm going to save this, refresh the browser. 
Notice nothing happens. The reason is that when I use cost, the 
JavaScript engine is attempting to find cost in the global space and it 
does not exist. So we need to use the keyword this in front of our 
properties of this particular object in order to get the correct price 
in this case, which is 10,000. Now once I've made those changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 21. The 
new code here is: return, this dot cost, +, open curve brackets, this, 
dot cost, multiplied by, .09, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>save my changes, I can refresh the browser screen and now we see the correct amount showing on the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The amount showing on the browser screen is 10900.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now of course, objects in JavaScript is a very vast topic, and I've 
just touched the surface of what we could do using JavaScript objects.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="f67e1c40-73a8-11e8-82d9-bf3deb09ab23">
The For...in Loop
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Double quote, The For, dot dot dot, in Loop, double quote. Your host for this session is, Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to talk about JavaScript objects and
 how we iterate over the properties of those objects. On the screen on 
the left side of your screen, we have an HTML document that has some 
JavaScript between lines 11 and 20. On the right side of your screen, 
there's a Chrome browser that is rendering the code that you see on the 
left, both HTML and JavaScript. Within the JavaScript code, there is an 
object being declared on line 12.</p>
<p>That object actually looks like an array because it looks like, well,
 every object is really a collection of names or keys and their values. 
And that's exactly what we're seeing here. The make in this case is a 
key and the value is Buick. So you might think then that we maybe able 
to use a for loop and iterate over this vehicle object, like I'm doing 
on line 16. However, if we look at the Chrome browser and render it, 
render the code on the left and look into the developer tools by hitting
 F12 on the keyboard, we see that something is undefined on line 17.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script, Iterating Object Properties. He clicks, the F12 button on the 
keyboard, a developer console window opens up. Following text with a 
number is displayed: 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, colon, 17 is undefined.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it appears as though we just can't iterate over the vehicle object</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 12. The code is: let vehicle, =, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>by iterating through, and thinking that each of the property has some kind of numeric value that we can access.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17. the code
 is: console, dot, log, open curved bracket, vehicle, open square 
bracket, i, close square bracket, close curved bracket, semi-colon. He 
highlights, i, from the code.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But we are able to access each of the properties via the key. So if I were to type in make here and save it, if I</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He replaces, i, with open quote, make, close quote, in the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen now I see the value of make, it happens to be Buick.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script, Iterating Object Properties. On developer console window, 
following text with a number is displayed: Buick. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, 
html, colon, 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now of course, it does not make sense in this case to attempt to print make the value Buick 3 times.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But JavaScript came up with a different way of accessing the keys and
 their values of this type of object. So what they came up with is the 
for in statement. So we can replace our original or traditional for with
 a for, something like let i in vehicle, something like that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 16. The code
 is: for, open curved bracket, let i, =, zero, semi-colon, i less than 
3, semi-colon, i plus plus, close curved bracket, open curved bracket. 
He highlights, let i, =, zero, semi-colon, i less than 3, semi-colon, i 
plus plus, and replaces with, i in vehicle.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now we may be able to access the keys in this case, which is represented by i.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17. He highlights, open quote, make, close quote, from the code line and replaces with i.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Actually, to make it a little bit nicer, we could use it in a 
structure like this, i plus, in other words, concatenation. And then we 
can probably use some kind of a colon like this and then concatenate the
 value by accessing the object and it's property in this case. So let's 
save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 17. In this code, before vehicle, he adds, i, +, double quote, colon, double quote, +.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>now we see that we're actually getting those keys and their values.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script, Iterating Object Properties. On developer console window, 
following text with a number is displayed: make, colon, Buick. 1 3 9 7 0
 4, dot, html, colon, 17. color, colon, red. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, 
colon, 17. year, colon, 2019. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, colon, 17. cost, 
colon, 10000. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, colon, 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this for in loop works really well with iterable objects like the 
vehicle object in this case and with things like arrays and maps,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>and that sort of thing. However, keep in mind that a vehicle object 
is made up of properties and methods. So if we were to add a method to 
our property object, it will also be caught up into this loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code line 12, 13, 
16 &amp; 17. The code on line 13 is: make, colon, open quote, Buick, 
close quote, comma, color, colon, open quote, Red, close quote, comma, 
year, colon, 2019, comma, cost, colon, 10000, comma.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So for example, if I were to insert some code in the vehicle object,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He inserts the code lines from 14 to 
18. The code in line 14 is: about me, open close curved bracket, open 
curly bracket. The code in line 15 is: return this, dot, make, + double 
quote, double quote, + The code in line 16 is: this, dot, color, + 
double quote, double quote, + The code on line 17 is: this, dot, year, 
semi-colon. The code in line 18 is: close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>in other words, I just inserted a function or method called aboutMe,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights, about me from the code line 14.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that is simply returning all of the properties concatenated together.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights from the code line 15 to 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, aboutMe is not a true property, it's a method. However, it's 
considered a property. So if I save all of this and refresh the browser 
screen, notice that the aboutMe got caught up in the for loop.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the codes in notepad++ file,
 and refreshes the browser. Following text appears on the screen: Java 
Script, Iterating Object Properties. On developer console window, 
following text with a number is displayed: make, colon, Buick. 1 3 9 7 0
 4, dot, html, colon, 17. color, colon, red. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, 
colon, 17. year, colon, 2019. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, colon, 17. cost, 
colon, 10000. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, html, colon, 17. about me, colon, about 
me, open close curved bracket, open curly bracket. 1 3 9 7 0 4, dot, 
html, colon, 22. return this, dot, make, + double quote, double quote, 
+. this, dot, color, + double quote, double quote, +. this, dot, year, 
semi-colon. close curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's something to watch for when you're dealing with objects, like objects that represent the real world.</p></div>

<h2 id="f9a9b9b0-73a8-11e8-82d9-bf3deb09ab23">
Constructor Functions
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title : Constructor Functions. Your presenter for this session : Axle Barr</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to be talking about Constructor 
Functions in JavaScript and how we use Constructor Functions to create 
new objects. What you're seeing on the screen is a Notepad++ application
 opened up and pointing to an HTML file with some JavaScript in the 
middle, or in the body tag. On the right of your screen, you're looking 
at Chrome rendering that file that you see on the left. Now JavaScript, 
being an object-oriented language, mean that we can create custom 
objects. And there are about three different ways of doing this. This is
 the Constructor Function for this particular demo, but we can also 
construct objects using an object literal.</p>
<p>We can also construct objects using the new keyword, but using a 
Constructor Function in this way allows us to create several objects of 
the same type. Since ES 6 JavaScript did introduce the class keyword. It
 is an attempt to simulate classes as they appear in Java, C#, C++. 
However, throughout this series I will be using the function keyword to 
make my classes. However, keep in mind, that a class in JavaScript as 
introduced by ES 6 is a special function in JavaScript. If we take a 
look at line 13, the function vehicle is creating an object. Now notice 
that</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 13 is: function, 
Vehicle, open curve bracket, make, comma, color, comma, year, close 
curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>vehicle has an uppercase V to start it off. This is an indication to 
other programmers that vehicle is a class and not a real function. As 
you can see, the vehicle object has some parameters in the Constructor. 
And these parameters go into making up this vehicle in terms of its 
make,color, year, etc.. So using this structure we can create a new 
object. So I can say something like, let myRide = new. I will still have
 to use the new keyword here, new Vehicle. But that new keyword allows 
me to make my object, so I can pass in something like Ford, White for 
the color. And let's say the year is 2009.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter adds a code on line 18.
 The code is: let, my ride, =, new vehicle, open curve bracket, open 
quote, Ford, close quote, comma, open quote, white, close quote, comma, 
open quote, 2009, close quote, close curve bracket, semicolon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just that one line, I have created a new object. Let's save 
our change, refresh our browser screen, hit F12 just to make sure that 
we don't have any errors. I'll hit F12 again to get rid of the developer
 tools. And I did say that, well before we create multiple objects, 
let's see how we can perhaps print one of the properties of this 
particular object, the myRide object. So I can use my p1, the paragraph 
tag and use the innerHTML of that tag.</p>
<p>And I'd like to display some kind of sentence here using my object. 
So I'm going to use the templated strings so I'll say, My current car is
 a, and I'll use templated strings here again so let's see. Now I can 
access my object which is myRide., and I'll access the make in this 
case. So with just that one sentence on line, or that one statement on 
line 19, if I refresh the screen, we see that my current car is a Ford.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter adds a code on line 19.
 the code is : p 1, dot, inner HTML, =, accent, my current car is a 
dollar sign, open curly bracket, my ride, dot, make, close curly 
bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So just to prove the point that we can create as many objects as we 
wish, I'm going to copy line 18 and put it on line 20. Let's see, let's 
copy that again, copy line 18. Put it on line 20 and simply change it to
 myFutureRide. So myFutureRide is not going to be a Ford maybe it's 
going to be a, let's see Toyota. And the color is going to be Black and 
of course it's going to be a 2019.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies code on line 
20 . The new code is, let my future ride = new vehicle, open curved 
bracket, open quote, toyota, close quote, comma, open quote, black, 
close quote, comma, open quote, 2019, close quote, close curved bracket,
 semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now if I refresh the screen, well, let's print it out first. So I can
 copy line 19, the current line 19, or cut it I should say. So I'm using
 Ctrl+X on the keyboard to cut that and then Ctrl+V to paste it 
underneath my future ride. And then I can just use myFutureRide instead 
of myRide. And save that change and we see that, well of course I'll 
have to say myFutureRide, or my future car is, let's just drop this down
 to the other line so we can see it better.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter cuts the code line 19 
and pastes it on code line 20. He modifies the code on line 20, the new 
code is, p1, dot, inner HTML, accent, My future car is a, dollar sign, 
open curly bracket, my future ride, dot make, close curly bracket, 
accent, semi-colon. He then, splits this code line in two lines for 
better visibility.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save those changes, refresh the screen and we see that my future car 
is a Toyota. So once again using Constructor Functions allows us to 
create as many objects as we wish.</p></div>

Object Methods
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title, Object Methods. Your presenter for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to discuss adding methods to 
existing objects in JavaScript. On the left side of your screen is an 
HTML document that is opened up with Notepad++. It has some JavaScript 
between lines 12 and 19, but of course this is going to change. On the 
right side of your screen is a Chrome application that is opened up and 
pointing to the HTML document that you see on the left of your screen. 
Let's focus on the HTML document that is on the left of your screen, and
 let's take a look at the object that was created on line 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 14 is: function, 
Vehicle, open curve bracket, make, comma, color, comma, year, close 
curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now JavaScript does not have a class, as such, but we can use a 
function to simulate a class. So our Vehicle object has three properties
 right now. And in order for me to continue with this particular 
demonstration, I'm going to add a fourth property to the object. So I'm 
going to add a new property to the Vehicle object. But, first of all, 
let's create the parameter. So next to year I'm going to create a new 
parameter there called cost.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 14, The new code is, function, Vehicle, open curve bracket, make, 
comma, color, comma, year, cost, close curve bracket, open curly 
bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And it means that I'm going to have to have now a cost property of 
the vehicle. So after line 17, I'm going to insert some code there, 
where I am assigning the value of cost, once an instance is</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter inserts a code on line 18. the code is : this, dot, cost, =, cost, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>created of this Vehicle class, assign that to the cost property of 
the Vehicle. But this demonstration is about methods, so how do we 
create a method? Well, believe it or not, all we really have in 
JavaScript is the function, and we can use this function to our 
advantage to create methods. Now, this particular Vehicle has some 
properties to it. And what I can do is create a new property called 
carDetails.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter created a new property 
on line 19. the code on line 19 is : this, dot, car details, =, 
function, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But in order to create a method for this function, I would then now 
have to point that carDetails property to a function. So I'm assigning a
 function to carDetails, and this is the way you would create methods 
for all of your objects in JavaScript. So on line 19, I have inserted 
some code where I'm creating a property called carDetails, pointing that
 to a function, and now I can flush out the function. So now I can add 
in the details that I want for this particular method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter added the details on 
line 20 and 21. the code on line 20 is: return, accent, the $ sign, open
 curly bracket, this, dot, year, close curly bracket, $ sign, open curly
 bracket, this, dot, make, close curly bracket. the code on line 21 is: 
will cost, $ sign, open curly bracket, this, dot, cost, close curly 
bracket, accent, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the method is going to return an entire sentence. It's going to 
say the year of the car, make, will cost whatever. So I have a 
full-fledged method now. Let's see how we can use this method. Now we 
have what in other languages would be a class, and in order to create an
 object we would, of course, have to create an instance of that object. 
So the way we would do that in JavaScriptable, first of all we would 
have to create a variable.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter creates a variable on line 24. the code is: let, my ride, =</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's establish a variable called myRide, and we will assign to that 
variable an instance of the Vehicle class. So on line 24 and 25, I've 
inserted some code where on line 24 I am creating or declaring a 
variable, and then assigning to that variable a Vehicle object by using 
the new keyword.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code which the presenter has 
added on line 25 is, new vehicle, open curve bracket, open quote, ford, 
close quote, comma, open quote, white, close quote, comma, open quote, 
2009, close quote, comma, open quote, 10000, close quote, close curve 
bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now that I have my instance called myRide, I can now use one of the 
paragraph tags on my HTML document to print out the carDetails method. 
So online 26 I have used my innerHTML of the p1 tag, and assigning</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 26 is, p1, dot, 
inner HTML, =, my ride, dot, , car details, open curve bracket, close 
curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>to that is the instance of my Vehicle object, which is myRide in this
 case. And from myRide I am invoking the carDetails function. Let's save
 all of these changes, refresh the browser screen, and you see that it 
says the 2009 Ford will cost $10,000. So this is one way of adding 
methods, to your object in this case. Now there are other ways, and as 
we move on in the series we'll discuss some of the other ways of adding 
methods to your existing objects.</p></div>

Prototyping
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title: prototyping Your presenter for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at the prototype 
keyword and see how we can use it to add properties and methods to an 
existing object in JavaScript. On the left side of your screen, there is
 an HTML document opened up in Notepad ++ with some JavaScript code in 
the middle. On the right of your screen, you're taking a look at how the
 Chrome browser is rendering that file on the left of your screen. I may
 have mentioned before that JavaScript does not really have classes, 
doesn't really use classes. There's no concept of designing a class and 
then creating instances of that class. In JavaScript, everything is an 
object. In class-based languages, you're unable to modify or add 
properties or methods to the class after you have defined the class. 
What I mean by that is that you can't add more properties and methods 
during run time. In JavaScript however, at run time you can add or 
remove properties from an object. So if we take a look at the object 
that we created on line 12,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 12 is: function, 
Vehicle, open curve bracket, make, comma, color, comma, year, comma, 
cost, close curve bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>this is the vehicle object. On line 25, I'm going to insert some code
 that is going to add a property to this object. So, let's just say it's
 a vehicle object and I want to add, let's see, model, we don't have 
models yet. That's really all I would need to do in order to</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 25 is: vehicle, dot, model, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>add a new property to the vehicle object. It means then, that on line
 26, I could if I wanted to, use the myRide instance that I have, if you
 want to consider it an instance. And then access the model of the model
 property of that ride. And I can probably make it equal to something, 
so lets say the Ford Explorer is, the Ford that we have is an Explorer.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 26 is: my ride, dot, model, =, open quote, explorer, close quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That's all I need to do to add a new property to my vehicle object. 
So on the right side of the screen, if I go back to Chrome, hit the F12 
button. Well first, let's refresh the browser to make sure that we pick 
up this change in code between lines 25 and 26.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter saves the changes in notepad++ and refreshes the chrome browser.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in the console window, I could for example, type myRide and choose
 the model property from the myRide object, hit the enter key and you 
see that we do have Explorer. But what is actually happening behind the 
screen is that we are actually using the prototype property of the 
vehicle object to add this particular property, this new property, this 
model property. So if I were to change Vehicle.model to 
Vehicle.prototype.model, save those changes, refresh the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter is referring to line 25.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can still access myRide.model, I hit the enter key, and as you can 
see, it is still working like normal. So this is the same technique that
 I'm going to use to create or to add a new function, or new method to 
the vehicle class. So if I wanted to do that again, I'm going to access 
that class that we have, so it's Vehicle.prototype of course, dot and 
whatever the name of my function is. So my method is going to be called 
getMSRP.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter is adding this code on line 27.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the function definition on line 17, it's 
basically the same thing we are going to do. So it's going to be equal 
to function, and I defined a space for my function to write my function.
 Now, in between the curly braces is where I'm going to define my 
function just like on 18 and 19. So what I want my MSRP to return is, 
well I want it to return something, so I've created a place for me to 
start defining what that return is going to be. So I want to return, 
let's see, the MSRP, so some sentence first.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 28 is: return, open quote, the MSRP on this, close quote, semicolons.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the first template is going to be, well actually, let's use the 
new property that we built on line 26. So I'm going to say this.model. 
Notice, I'm using the this key word. All the way out here on line 28, 
I'm using the this key word. Now, so the MSRP on this model is, this 
times the cost or this cost times 0.9, because all of our markups are 
90%. And believe it or not, that's all I need to do in order to add a 
new method to the vehicle class.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 28 is modified to: 
return, accent, the MSRP on this, $ sign, open curly brackets, this, 
dot, model, close curly bracket, is, $ sign, open curly brackets, this, 
dot, cost, multiplied by point 9, close curly bracket, accent, 
semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can save those changes, refresh my browser screen, and now I can access</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is working on chrome web developer console now.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the myRide dot, let's see, getMSRP, put my parenthesis, hit the enter
 key. And notice it says that the MSRP on this Explorer is $9,000. So 
this makes JavaScript's objects or working with objects a little bit 
more flexible than in the traditional way of using classes and things 
like that.</p></div>

Inheritance and Extending Classes
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> topic title: inheritance and extending classes. your presenter for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at inheritance in 
JavaScript and figure out what the role of the prototype key word is 
going to play in inheritance. On your screen, we have Notepad++ opened 
on the left. And it's pointing to an HTML file with JavaScript in the 
middle of it. On the right side of your screen, you're looking at 
Chrome. And Chrome is rendering the HTML document that you see on the 
left. JavaScript, remember, is a prototype based language. So there's 
really no concept of a class as such. Every time we create an object in 
JavaScript, we're actually linking to some other object via its 
prototype. In fact, whenever you create an object like we're doing on 
line 12, we are creating a vehicle object using the function keyword.</p>
<p>Once we create a new object, we get for free something called the 
prototype property of that object. So putting it another way, every 
object that you create in JavaScript has a prototype property. And it is
 the prototype property that we must use whenever we try to do 
inheritance in JavaScript. So I'm going to start inserting some code on 
line 24 and 25 to demonstrate this. So on line 24, I'm going to insert 
some comments. And then on line 25 I will start defining a new object 
that I'm going to be using. And I'm going to base this new object on the
 vehicle object. So on line 25, I'm going to create a SUV object, okay? 
And the SUV object, of course, is going to have a constructor function. 
And I'm going to use that constructor function to pass in, let's say two
 parameters, size and the passengers.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter put double forward 
slash in line 24 and wrote codes in line 25. the code on line 25 is: 
function, SUV, open curve bracket, size, comma, passengers, close curve 
bracket, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now notice we don't have size and passengers for vehicle. Now, once 
the user of this object decides to use the SUV object, they need to pass
 me size and passengers. And I'll take those two numbers and assign it 
to the SUV's size. So this.size is going to be equal to the size that 
the user of this object will pass in. And I'm going to do the same thing
 with passengers.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter writes code on line 26. The code is, this, dot, size, =, size, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this.passengers will be equal to the number of passengers that was passed in.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the presenter added code on line 27. The code is, this, dot, passengers, =, passengers, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now that I have a new object, I'm going to use the prototype 
property of this new object. So on line 29 let's insert some comments. 
And on line 30 I'm going to use SUV.prototype. So I'm using the 
prototype property of the SUV object. And to that I'm going to assign 
the constructor of the vehicle object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 30 is: SUV, dot, prototype, =, new vehicle, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So line 30 is what will cause inheritance to happen. So now I can 
actually try to create an SUV object. So on line 31 let's create a 
variable to hold our object. So let's call this object or this new 
instance the explorer. And to that we are going to, and we'll use 
explorer to create this new SUV object. So let explorer = new SUV(). So 
we have a new explorer instance of the SUV object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 31 is: let explorer, =, new SUV, open curve bracket, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And, of course, we're going to have to pass to the constructor 
function the size and passengers. So let's fill in those parentheses 
with the size and passengers.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter put the size and number
 of passengers in code 31, Now, the code is, let explorer, =, new SUV, 
open curve bracket, open quote, Mid, close quote, comma, open quote, 6, 
close quote, close curve bracket, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And really that's all we need to do to demonstrate inheritance. 
Because now that explorer object has access to everything in the vehicle
 object. So I can do something like this, well, on line 32 I'm going to 
put in a comment. And then beneath that I'm going to say explorer., now I
 can access the make of the explorer object. And I can have that 
assignment, let's say something like Ford.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 33 is: explorer, dot, make, =, open quote, ford, close quote, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I can also access all of the other properties of the vehicle object. So for example, I can say explorer.cost = 12000 let's say.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> the code on line 34 is: explorer, dot, cost, =, 12000, semi-colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's it, that's all I have to do. Let's save these changes, 
refresh the browser screen. And in the developer tools, what I'm going 
to do is I'm going to access that explorer object. So explorer, ., let's
 say cost. And it will give me 12000. Now, explorer., let's say year 
will not give me anything because I did not define what that year is. 
But I have just demonstrated with the use of the prototype keyword how 
to establish or how to implement inheritance in JavaScript.</p></div>

Exercise: Working with Functions and Objects
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Exercise: Working with Functions and Objects. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, we will use JavaScript objects to first of all 
create an employee object with certain properties, first name, last 
name, and salary. The employee object will have one method, and that 
method is going to return the first name and last names concatenated 
together. You will then use prototypical inheritance to add yet another 
method. This method will return the first and last names, as well as the
 salary all concatenated together. So to add a new method, it's the same
 concept as adding a property that you would have seen in a prior video.
 Create an employee object to test out that second method. Now you may 
pause the video, try this problem on your own, and then return to the 
video to see how I would approach this particular problem. So the first 
thing we needed to do was create an employee object with the first name,
 last name, and salary.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A notepad ++ with scripts and a browser is displayed.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've already done this between lines 12 and lines 19.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: function, 
employee, open curve bracket, f name, comma, l name, comma, salary, 
close curve bracket, open curly bracket. The code on line 13 is: this 
dot f name, = f name, semi colon. The code on line 14 is: this dot l 
name, = l name, semi colon. The code on line 16 is: this dot salary, = 
salary, semi colon. The code on line 17 is: this dot full name, = 
function, open close curve brackets, open curly bracket. The code on 
line 18 is: return, accent, $ sign, open curly bracket, this dot f name,
 close curly bracket, $ sign, open curly bracket, this dot l name, close
 curly bracket, accent, semi colon. The code on line 19 is: close curly 
bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The second thing was that this employee object should have one method
 that returns the first and last names concatenated that you see on line
 17. Now we need to use prototypical inheritance to add yet another 
method. And this method is going to return not just the first and last 
names concatenated, but also the salary is going to be concatenated. And
 it's the same concept as when we did property inheritance. So remember 
that every object created in JavaScript has a prototype property. That's
 the property that we can use to simulate inheritance. So we've already 
got an employee object, so all I need to do is tap in to that prototype 
property and add on any functionality that I need. So what I could do is
 start by declaring this statement, Employee.prototype.nameAndSalary. So
 I'm going to be calling my new method name and the salary. Now I need a
 method here, so that statement is going to be equal to some type of 
function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new line of code on line 
21. The code here is: Employee dot prototype dot name and salary = 
function, open close curve brackets, open curly bracket.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now what I place in the function would be something like this, I 
would say let's return some sentence. So basically, I'm going to be 
using this method to return an entire sentence. So that sentence is 
going to be, and well I know I need at least one template. And maybe 
I'll add some words works for. So I need two templates at this point. 
Now you might be thinking, well it should be three, it should be first 
name, last name, and salary. But remember, we already have a method that
 returns the full name. That method has been started on line 16 and ends
 on line 18. So let's use that method here, okay. So this.fullName as a 
method call will return the entire name. So all we really need to do now
 is insert the salary itself within the return statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 22. The 
code here is: return, accent, $ sign, Open curly bracket, this dot full 
name, open close curve bracket, close curly bracket, works for, $ sign, 
open curly bracket, this dot salary, close curly bracket, accent, semi 
colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I believe this is all we need, but the next thing that we would 
want to do is create a new object, an employee object. So let TJones, 
let's say, so this is the name of the employee, that's going to be equal
 to a new employee object, right.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 25, The 
code here is: let T Jones = He adds a new code on line 26. The code here
 is: new, employee, open curve bracket, open quote, tom, close quote, 
comma, open quote jones, close quote, comma, open quote, 55000, close 
quote, close curve bracket, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we'll have to fill in that employee object, the constructor I 
mean, with the first name, last name, and salary. Once we have that, the
 last thing would be to print it out. So we've already got a p1 tag. 
Let's use that p1 tag, the innerHTML of that p1 tag, to display TJones, 
which is our new employee object, period and then the name of the method
 that we want to use which is nameAndSalary.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a new code on line 27. The 
code here is: p 1, dot inner HTML, =, t jones, period, name and salary, 
open close curved brackets, semi colon.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's it, that would be all that we need to do. Now I can save 
these changes, and let's refresh the browser screen to see what these 
changes will look like. Let's refresh the browser screen, and there you 
see that Tom Jones works for $55,000.</p></div>
