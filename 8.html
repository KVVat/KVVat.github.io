<h1>JavaScript Front-end Development: Frameworks</h1>
<p>Discover how to work with JavaScript language frameworks, such as 
Angular, Vue.js, and React, for creating dynamic front end content for 
full stack applications.  During this course, you will start by learning
 how Angular controllers can be used to interact with data. Next you 
will observe how to sort and filter data, as well as use Angular to 
validate user form input and format output. Other topics you will 
explore include how to understand Vue.js concepts and implement the 
Vue.js library; and how to use components and directives to make a 
view.js project structure. From there, you will study key concepts of 
Reactive programming for web page construction, and how to consider the 
React and JSX relationship. You'll learn how to embed expressions in 
JSX, and finally conclude the course by learning how to use the React 
virtual DOM to update page elements.</p>

Setting Up the Angular Environment
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Setting Up the Angular Environment. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to start looking at AngularJS. As 
usual, I have an HTML document opened in Notepad++, it's a very simple 
HTML document. And on the right side of your screen there's a Chrome 
browser rendering the document that you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, the heading is: 
AngularJS Typical Project. There is a input box present here. Above the 
input box, the following text is written: Enter something, anything: 
Below the input box, This is what you are entering: is written.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>AngularJS is meant to be used on a single webpage. So it's more of a 
front-end browser-based technology, although it could be used on the 
server side. It is a JavaScript framework, meaning that we just need to 
link to the library via CDN. And then we have access to all of the 
functionality of the framework. Now, of course, we could download the 
raw files and attach it that way. AngularJS is part of the MEAN Stack, 
MongoDB Express Angular and Node.js. AngularJS is styled on the MVC 
model, model view controller. And it's also easy to bind HTML elements 
to input data or to external data.</p>
<p>And that data part is considered the model part of MVC. There's also a
 view, and these views can be considered templates. And an example could
 be a list of states in the United States. These views are inserted into
 the page using something called expressions. And then, of course, 
pure.js can be used to control the functionality of views and the 
models, and so we can consider pure.js as the controller. But for this 
demonstration, we're going to look at setting up the environment using 
directives, as well as using expressions. So the first thing we'll want 
to do is, of course, get the framework. So, as usual, between the head 
tags, I'm going to insert some script tags. And the source of my script 
tag will be pointing to a CDN.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter adds code on lines 5 
and 6. The code on line 5 is: &lt;script src= ""&gt;. Between the two 
double quotes, he adds the following link: 
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js. 
The code on line 6 is: &lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Which just happens to be the same area on the googleapis.com website 
that has jQuery. So once we have that installed, it means then that I 
now have the functionality of the library. So in my body tag, what I'm 
going to do is I'm going to insert a directive called ng-app.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 8. The code is: &lt;body ng-app&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That directive is going to get the library ready to be used in the 
rest of the document. All directives actually start with ng. The other 
thing to note here is that because I've placed my ng-app directive in my
 body tag. It means that anything between my body tags now have access 
to all of the functionality that is incorporated into this AngularJS 
framework. So now I can start using other directives. So where my input 
tag is on line 12, I'm going to use another directive there called 
ng-model. To that directive I am going to assign something, and actually
 I'm just going to use the word something. I can use any word I want, I 
can use an X here if I wanted to.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 12. The code here is: &lt;input type="text" ng-model ="something"/&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>What this means is that our something will hold values that the user 
types into this text box. And that something, if you want to consider it
 a variable, that variable is now assigned to the global object or the 
scope object. Which simply means now that I can access something from 
anywhere on this webpage. In fact, we can even use something to pass 
data off to a database. So since I have access to something, I can now 
use it in something called an expression. And expressions are usually 
typed within a pair of curly braces. So on line 16, where I have my span
 tag,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 16. The code is: &lt;span style="fontâ€”size : 1 . 4em; "&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to insert there a pair of curly braces. And within that 
pair of curly braces, I can insert any expression I want, including the 
variable something.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code line 16. The new code is: &lt;span style="font-size : 1 . 4em; "&gt;{ {something} } &lt;/span&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So once I have done all of these changes, I can save all of these 
changes, refresh my browser page now. Whenever I type something into 
this text box, it should show up on that span tag. So let's type 
something like Skillsoft. And notice what happens at the bottom, it just
 even types, it reflects every letter that I typed into that text box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, he types 
Skillsoft in the input box. Skillsoft also reflects under the following 
text: This is what you are entering:</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's the power of AngularJS.</p></div>

Angular Controllers and Services
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Angular Controllers and Services. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to continue on the topic of 
AngularJS. We will now look at the role of controllers in Angular. As 
usual, on the screen, I have an HTML document opened in Notepad++. We've
 got a few JavaScript tags in between. And on the right hand side, we 
have a Chrome browser rendering the file you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text is present on the screen: " AngularJS Typical Project" "A message from your controller:".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As with most Angular App applications, we need to start with a 
directive in the body tag. So on line 8, I'm going to insert my ng-app 
directive. And to that, I'm going to assign it at the name of an 
application and this can be any name you wish and in my case here, I 
will decide to call this ssApp.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter declares a code on line 8. The code is:&lt;body ng-app="ssApp" &gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, in order to continue developing our module called ssApp or 
application called ssApp, we need to use something from the framework 
called module. So between my script tags between line 15 and 17, I'm 
going to start inserting some code. I'm going to, first of all, assign a
 variable. I'll just call it ngApp. And I am going to point that to the 
angular.module method. And that method takes two parameters. Now the 
first parameter will be the name of our application, which we just 
inserted on line 8. And the second parameter is actually an array that 
holds directives, other directives services, etc. But for this 
application, we don't have any, so we're going to leave that blank.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter declares a code on line 16. The code is: let ngApp = angular.module( ' ' , [ ] ) ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So again on line 16, I'm going to pass, as the first parameter, the name of my application which I declared on line 8.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 16. The new code is: let ngApp = angular.module( ' ssApp ' , [ ] ) ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So essentially, what line 16 is saying is that, let this variable 
called ngApp, let that object represent our application. It stands in 
place of our application or it stands for our application. So now that 
we have this Angular module object, we can now create our controller. So
 ngApp by default, being an Angular module object, will have a 
controller function. We can use that function to pass as the first 
parameter is string that represents our controller name. So on line 17, 
I'm going to use my ngApp and the controller function and that function 
will take two parameters. The first one will be our name, the second 
will be a function. Now that function itself, let's make some space 
here.</p>
<p>That function itself has to have, as a parameter, the scope object. 
Remember the scope object is considered a global object. So remember the
 first parameter will contain the name of our controller. And this can 
be anything you want, so I just called mine ssControlr.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 17. The new code on line 17 is: ngApp.controller( ' ss Controlr', function ($scope) {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with this structure in place, we can now use our scope object to 
attach to it any variable we wish. So in this case, I'm going to say I'm
 going to create a variable called someString. And once I have my 
variable in place, I can pass to it anything I want, I could pass 
objects if I wanted to. But because it's a very simple application, I'm 
going to pass just a simple string. Or I should say we're going to 
assign a simple string to a variable called someString, remember 
someString is now attached to this scope object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 18. The 
code is: $scope.someString = "Lessons from Skillsoft" ;. Successive code
 lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Great, so now that we have an object called someString, we can use 
that anywhere on the page. So in this case, we will use it on line 12 
between our span tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 12. The code is: &lt; span style="font-size:1.4em;"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But before we can access the value in our variable, we need to insert
 a directive into the span tag. In this case, it will be a controller 
directive and we will point it to the controller that we created in this
 app, remember that was called ssController. So let's insert that into 
the assignment statement.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 12. He 
then modifies the code on line 12. The new code is: &lt; span 
ng-controller="ssControlr" style="font-size:1.4em;" &gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now with all of this in place, we can now access our someString 
variable. Remember, the way we do that is between the two pairs of curly
 braces, we will insert the variable that we wish to display on to the 
screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 13. The code is: { {someString} }. Successive code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And really, that's it. So now I can save these changes and refresh 
the browser and there we see the value of that someString variable, 
which we created using that scope object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following value appears in the 
browser, "Lessons from Skillsoft". The presenter, highlights this value.
 He highlights "someString" in the codes, on line 13 and 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div>
</div>

<h2 id="0c3c9330-89c1-11e8-9c58-b7993da8b1b4">
Angular Filters
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Angular Filters. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to continue talking about AngularJS.
 And in particular, we'll talk about filters. On the left of your 
screen, there's an HTML document opened in Notepad++. And on the right 
of screen, there is a Chrome browser rendering the HTML document on your
 left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text: "AngularJS Filter Demo:" is present on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Filters in AngularJS is like a factory or a service. It allows us to 
format the data that is going to be displayed. But we never affect the 
original list. That stays as is. Filters can be used with expressions or
 directives. And there's a special pipe character that is used to 
separate out the object from the criteria. Angular does have built in 
filters to format data of different data types. There are filters for 
numbers, currency, dates, etc. For this demonstration, I'll show a 
couple of different examples of filtering. So let's head over to the 
HTML document and on line 10 and 11, we have some script tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The tag on line 10 is: &lt; script &gt;. The tag on line 11 is: &lt;/script&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the first thing that I'm going to do is make some space for 
myself. So on line 11, I'm going to declare a variable. I'm going to 
call it ssApp. Now, I can call it anything I want. And I'm going to 
assign to that variable the angular.module method. And remember, that 
module method takes two parameters. We don't have any special directives
 to pass to it, so the second parameter will be an empty array. But the 
first parameter is going to be the name of our application that we 
declared on line 6 in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 6 is: &lt; body 
ng-app="ssApp" &gt;. The presenter enters a new line of code on line 11.
 The code here is: let ssApp = angular.module('ssApp' , [ ] ) ;. The 
successive code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now I have to use a controller and I'm going to use my div tag on line 8, the one ID'd as demo.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 8. The code here is: &lt;div id="demo" &gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to use that div tag to display my content. So let's invoke the ngController directive.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 8 and 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And for now, I'm just going to point it to some name that I just made up. So I'm just going to call my controller, ssController.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 8. The new code here is:&lt;div id="demo" ng-controller="ssController"&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then on line, let's see, I've got a variable already created that is 
pointing to my angular module object. So let's use that ssApp variable 
and access the controller method. Remember that controller method? We 
are going to pass it the name of our controller, so I've called it 
ssController in this case. And then we pass it a function, and that 
function itself is going to take or accept the scope object, or the 
scope parameter, I should say. Which is, in fact, an object. Now, once I
 have that scope object, it becomes a global variable, so I'm going to 
make some space here within the function. I'm going to define this 
function now. And I'm going to use my scope object, attach to it a 
variable called today. Now, the rest of this will just be plain old 
JavaScript. I'm going to point that or assign to today a variable the 
new date, which will be today's date, the date that I'm recording this 
particular video.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes from line 12 to 14.
 The code on line 12 is: ssApp.controller("ssController", function 
($scope) {. The code on line 13 is: $scope.today = new Date ( ) ;. The 
code on line 14 is: } );. Successive code lines shift 3 lines down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now that I have the variable today, I'm going to head back over to my
 div tag on line 8. I'm going to make some space for myself. And 
remember, whenever we work with AngularJS variables, we put them in 
between a pair of curly braces. So within that pair of curly braces, I'm
 going to use the today variable and apply a filter by using that pipe 
character. And the filter that I want to apply to that today is a date. 
And I'm going to pass to that date the format that I want to filter the 
today variable by. And that format is going to be dd/MMM/yyyy. So that 
should give me today's date, but with the month all spelled out in the 
three letter format.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 9. The code is: { { today | date: 'dd/MMM/yyyy' } }. Successive code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with that in place, I can save the change, refresh the browser 
screen, and there's my date filtered according to the specifications on 
line 9.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following date appears on the 
browser screen:06/Jul/2018. The presenter, then highlights this date. He
 refers to the code on line 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But more typically though, you tend to use filters with collections. 
So I'm going to head back over to my controller method on line 13. And 
on line 14, I have already used the scope object. So I'm going to use 
that again on line, let's say 15 now. So that scope object, I'm going to
 attach another variable to it called fruits. And to that fruits, I'm 
going to assign some kind of an array. So I'm going to define my array 
with let's see, one, two, three, four items in it and I'm just going to 
fill it up with just some strings.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 15. The 
code is: $scope.fruits = [ "Orange", "Pear", "Apple", "Plum" ] ;. 
Successive code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Once I have my array, then I can head back over to my div tag on line
 8. I'm going to, first of all, use a break tag to display the next set 
of filtering on the next line.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a break tag at the end of line 9. The tag is: &lt;br/&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And again, I'm going to use a pair of those curly braces, two pairs 
of curly braces. And inside of there, I am going to start with my fruits
 array, which remember, is part of that scope object. I'm going to 
filter it by using that pipe character. And after the pipe character, I 
have to give it a criteria. So I'm going to start, well first of all, we
 have to use the keyword filter, followed by the criteria. So that 
criteria for now is going to be PL.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 10. The code is: { { fruits | filter: 'pl' } }. Successive code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that means that by creating this filter, what it's doing is it's 
going to take that fruits array, fruits object, and it's going to look 
for anything that has a P and L next to it. So for now that looks like 
plum, as well as apple.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 16. He 
highlights 'pl' in line 10, then he highlights the following: 'fruits', 
'Pl' in plum, and 'pl' in Apple in line 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and there is Plum and Apple.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following result appears on the browser screen below the date: ["Apple","Plum"]. The presenter, highlights this text.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, if I were to just filter by P alone, let's see what happens.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 10. The new code is: { { fruits | filter: 'p' } }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I get actually three items coming back.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He saves the file in Notepad++, and refreshes the browser. The result for fruits changes to:["Pear","Apple","Plum"].</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's the way filtering works, AngularJS does have a filter 
method. But for this demonstration, I did not use the filter method.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="0e76a4b0-89c1-11e8-9c58-b7993da8b1b4">
Validating Input
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Validating Input. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at form validation 
using AngularJS. And what I have opened up on the screen is an html 
document. I also have a very simple style sheet that I need to use in 
order to show some of the effects of AngularJS and the validation within
 it.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> Both these files are open in notepad++</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We also have a Chrome browser on the right side of your screen, that is actually rendering the document you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The heading on the browser screen is: Angular JS Form Validation. The screen also shows an text box for User Name.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first thing I'd like you to notice is that we have imported 
another Angular file, it's angular-messages.js and I've imported that 
via cdn and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter refers to the code on 
line 5 in the html file. The code here is: &lt;script src="https: 
//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-messages[1.3.16[angular-messages.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that gives me access to the AngularJS messages module. Now, AngularJS
 does not require that module but it does make life a lot easier for 
developers if you included that module. So then on line 19, I can pass 
that module via that array to my application called ssApp. So on line 
19, I'm going to insert the ngMessages module and that</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After modification, the code on line 19 is: let ssApp=angular.module ( 'ssApp' , [' ngMessages ']) ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>now gives my ssApp, which was declared on line 10, access to all of the messages and all of the functionality of ngMessages.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 10 is: &lt;body ng-app="ssApp"&gt;. He then points to ngMessages in the code on line 19.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the control or HTML element that we are going to wire up using 
form validation in AngularJS is the info tag that you see on line 14. So
 sometimes, you will hear developers refer to these HTML elements as 
controls.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is: &lt;input type="text" name="uname" &gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>However, underneath the input type = text tag, there is a div tag and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is &lt;div&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the div tag, in this case, on line 15 will act as a container. We are
 going to pass to that container the error object from ngMessages. And 
in order to do that, we need to be able to connect it to the form itself
 and the control. So, we'll use the directive again, ng-messages, it's 
going to be equal to the name of the form and we're going to chain to 
that the user name, uname, which is the control that we're looking at. 
And to that, we will chain the error object. So now, the error object 
which contains a key value pair for all the areas that occur on, within 
this element, this input type is equal to text element, that will now be
 available to anything on inside of this container, the div container.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 15. The new code is: &lt;div ng-messages="aForm.uname.$error"&gt;. 
He highlights the code on line 15 and 16. The code on line 16 is: 
&lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The next thing we're going to do is the control itself, line 14, 
we're going to add a directive, ng-model. Remember, ng-model will bind 
our control to the application, ssApp, on line 10. So we can give this 
any name we wish. In this case, I'm just going to call it uname. And the
 first thing that I'm going to listen for is we're going to listen to 
see if the user did not enter anything into the text box. So I'm going 
to use the regular required, HTML required attribute for that text box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 14. The code here is: &lt;input type="text" name="uname" ng-model="uname" required&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what all of this means so far is that, if the user did not type 
anything into that text box, then our error object will contain the fact
 that that required requirement was not fulfilled. And therefore we now 
have an error, we have a property of that error object. So now, in order
 to see some kind of message, I would now, within that div container, I 
would include some paragraph text. So between lines 15 and 16, I'm going
 to include a pair of paragraph tags. And again, I'm going to use the 
ng-messages attribute and pass to it the required value. And so now, if 
the user did not type anything into that input box, then what I want to 
have happen is they want to have that paragraph display a message, in 
this case, it's Mandatory field.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new line of codes on lines 
16, 17 and 18. The code on line 16 is: &lt;p ng-message=â€œrequired"&gt;. 
The code on line 17 is: Mandatory field. The code on line 18 is: 
&lt;/p&gt;. The successive code lines shift 3 lines below.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with all of these in place, I can save the changes, refresh the 
browser's screen and immediately we see Mandatory field because nothing 
has been entered into that text box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, following message appears below the user name text box: Mandatory field.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So the moment I start typing something into that text box, the 
Mandatory field message disappears because remember, our ng-model is 
listening for anything that's happening inside of that text box.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter types ss, in the text box on the browser screen. The Mandatory field message, disappears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So to take this a little bit further, let's say we had a minimum 
requirement. So I'm just going to move my line down to line 15, so that I
 have some room to type in. And let's say that our minimum length 
ng-minlength needs to be, let's say 4 in this case. So I can say that I 
want my minimum length to be 4. Remember I'm using an ng-minlength 
directive.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter shifts, required &gt; 
from the code on line 14 to line 15. He then modifies the code on line 
15. The new code here is: ng-minlength= "4 " required&gt;. The 
succeeding code lines shift one line below.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It means then that that now, we're going to be listening to see if 
the user typed in four characters here. So again, I'm going to display 
another message if they don't enter four characters. So I can now copy 
and paste line 17 and between lines 17 to 19, I can copy that, paste it 
over and instead of required, it's going to be minlength.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new code lines on lines 20, 
21 and 22. The code on line 20 is: &lt;p ng-message="minlength"&gt;. The
 code on line 21 is: Mandatory field. The code on line 22 is: 
&lt;/p&gt;. The succeeding code lines shift 3 lines below.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And the message I want to issue is something like, must be at least 
4, at least 4 characters, something like that. So that's my messages, 
that's my message.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 21. The new code here is: Username must be at least 4 characters!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Now, we still 
have the same mandatory field. If I start typing, it goes away. But 
notice the message changes to at least 4 characters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, following 
message appears below the user name text box: Mandatory field. The 
presenter types s, in the text box. The message changes to: Username 
must be at least 4 characters!.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's go to 4 characters. So I have one so far, two, three, four, the message disappears.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter types ssss, in the text box on the browser screen. The message disappears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we can even take it further. So we can also add an ng-maxlength. And we're going to make that equal to let's see, 8.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 15. The new code here is: ng-minlength=" 4 " ng-maxlength=" 8 "required&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we needed between 4 and 8 characters. So again, I'm going to copy 
the paragraph tag that I had before and paste it and just change 
minlength to maxlength and change the message to username must be less 
than 8 characters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter copies the code from 
lines 20, 21, and 22, and pastes them on lines 23, 24, and 25. He then 
modifies the code on lines 23, 24, and 25. The code on line 23 is: &lt;p
 ng-message= "maxlenqth"&gt;. The code on line 24 is: Username must be 
less than 8 characters! The code on line 25 is: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the changes. Refresh the browser screen. Now we have the 
Mandatory field. I can start typing one, two, three, four, that goes 
away. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And, so once I pass the eighth
 character, then I get the message that the username must be less than 
eight characters.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser screen text box, the 
presenter types s, 10 times. The following message displays: Username 
must be less than 8 characters!</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Somethings to note about this application is that when you use your 
required attributes, in this case, for my paragraph tag, all of my 
attributes must be inside of the div tag that contains the error object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the codes on line 17 and 16.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that in the attribute for the element 
itself, the HTML element itself. When we use those directives it's 
ng-minlength.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights ng-minlength in the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But when we use it within the error object itself, there's no dash, it's just minlength and maxlength, etc.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on lines 20 and 23.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's how easy it is to use form validation with AngularJS.</p></div>

Formatting Output
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Formatting Output. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to take a look at AngularJS and 
filtering, which allows us to do formatting. As usual, I have an HTML 
document opened in Notepad++. And on the right of your screen, there is a
 Chrome browser rendering the file you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The heading in the chrome browser is: Angular JS Filtering. A text box for Amount is also present .</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Included between the head tags is a link to a CDN that's going to grab the AngularJS library for me and apply it to this page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The link is present in the code line 
4. The code is not completely visible. The visible portion of the code 
is: &lt; script 
src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.16/angular</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So formatting and filtering is almost the same thing in AngularJS. 
It's how we get better looking HTML. And there are some built-in 
filters, such as currency, dates and the casing, meaning we can turn 
letters into uppercase or lowercase. So filters can be added to 
templates, controllers, directives or even services. And of course, it 
is possible to add your own custom filter. So these filters helps us 
organize our data and we can display only what we want to have 
displayed. And in a format we want to have displayed by using some type 
of criteria in the filter. In this demonstration, we're going to use the
 currency filter to format some numbers.</p>
<p>And we want those numbers to appear as currency and that we'll be 
using North American style for that. There are two ways we can use the 
currency filter. In the first instance here, we'll be using an HTML 
template and an AngularJS directive. The second method of course is to 
use JavaScript and use an AngularJS controller. So I'll show you the 
simple way first. So we've got an HTML document and with the on line 12,
 we've got an input tag there, that's where we are going to enter some 
amount. So let's wire that up so it is now being listened to by 
AngularJS. And remember that ng-model, if we give it some value, indeed 
that value can be anything. But once we include our ng-model directive 
here, it means now that AngularJS is listening to that particular HTML 
element or control. Sometimes you may hear the word binding.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 12. The code here is: &lt;input type="text" name="camount" ng-model="amount"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So once that is bound, we can use those span tags underneath, which 
is going to appear next to our box on the HTML document. We can now 
insert our pair of curly braces, two pairs of curly braces. And once we 
have that in place, we can access the amount input box because it's now 
bound. And we can use a pipe filter to tell the amount what we want to 
have displayed. So in this case, we're saying let's filter this amount, 
whatever value you've got in amount. Let's filter that through a 
currency filter.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 13. The code here is: &lt;span id="curr"&gt;{<!-- -->{amount | currency}}&lt;/span&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And actually that would be all. I can save the changes, refresh the 
browser screen. And if I type something like 123, notice what's 
happening on where the span tags are. We're filtering that 123 into 
$123.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the browser screen, the presenter types 123 in the text box. $123.00 appears besides the text box.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we can actually control the decimal places. If we go back to line
 13 where I have my currency, I can include something like a $, a : and 
then a 0.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 13, the presenter types : "$" :0, next to the word 'currency'.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If I saved those changes, refreshed the browser screen and I type 
123, notice that there is no .00. In other words, what I'm saying, let's
 restrict our output to no decimal places at all. Now the other way to 
do this is using JavaScript. And as you can see, I've added in some code
 here that I didn't have before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new codes in the html file on lines 8-25.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We have an application now, an actual application with a name. I've also included a controller on line 8 where my body tag is.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 8 is: &lt; body ng-app="ssApp" ng-controller="ssController"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Once I have that, I can initialize my application on line 17.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 17 is: let ssApp = angular.module ( ' ssApp' , [ ] ) ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And within that, I can use the controller and pass to it a function. 
That function is going to have our global scope, as well as our filter 
scope, our filter object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 18. The code here is: ssApp.controller('ssController', function ($scope, $filter) {<!-- --></em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We can then use our scope object to listen to the amount text box for any changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He points to the code on line 12. The code here is: &lt; input type="text" name="cAmount" ng-model="amount"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If there are any changes, then whatever values are typed into that box will be passed into our scope.watch function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 19. The code here is: $scope.$watch('amount', function (val) {<!-- --></em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Which will then take that amount and filter it using the currency filter.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code on line 20. The code here is: $scope.dollars = $filter ('currency')(val);</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So then the dollars on our webpage, which is again, attached to the 
scope object, will have the filtered value, whatever that filtered value
 happens to be. So if you notice, I've changed line 13 where I had my 
span tag before. Well, it's the same span tag but we're just using the 
dollars variable now, which is attached to our scope object. Which is a 
global object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: &lt; span id="curr"&gt;{<!-- -->{ dollars }}&lt; /span&gt;. The presenter also refers to $scope in the code on line 20.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So once I have all of this in place, if you notice, I can actually 
type in the same numbers and it works just like I had before. I can even
 type in the the cents part of it. And as you can see, the filtering is 
done just like we would expect.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter shifts to the browser 
screen and types 123.36 in the text box. $123.36 appears in the decimal 
form besides the text box.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div>
</div>

AngularJS Services
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: AngularJS Services. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to work with AngularJS Services. 
As usual, I have an HTML document opened in Notepad++ to the left of 
your screen. And we have Chrome on the right of your screen rendering 
all of the changes that I'm going to make on that HTML document on the 
left of your screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The heading on the browser screen is:
 AngularJS Services. There is an input box for Number to square. The 
page also features a button labeled Square Number. Below the button 
following text is written: Answer: {<!-- -->{}} .</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Angular services are really just functions that conform to what 
they're calling now the single responsibility principle. Meaning that 
each of these functions will really only do one thing and do that one 
thing well. So this makes services easy to implement. And, an AngularJS 
service is functionality that some other component depends on, usually a
 controller. But it could be another service or it could be a filter or 
it could be a directive. In our example here, we're going to use the 
controller. So we going to say that our controller depends on this 
service. So taking a look at the HTML document, on line 4, I'm already 
connecting to our AngularJS library via a CDN.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 4 is: &lt;script src="https: //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1 . 6 . 9/angular.min.js.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 7, I've declared that I'm going to be using an app using the ng-app directive given my app and name.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 7 is: &lt;body ng-app="ssApp"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And on line number 9, where I have a div tag, I'm saying that I'm going to be using a controller.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: &lt;div ng-controller="CController"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That controller also has a name. On line number 11, we have a HTML 
controller, an HTML element, the input type is equal to number. And to 
that I I have bound it to the scope object using the ng-model directive.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: &lt;input type="number" ng-model="number" /&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>There is a new directive on line 12, which we've not seen before, that's the ng-click directive.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: &lt;button ng-click="squareIt() "&gt;Square Number&lt;/button&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've assigned to it a function called squareIt. Now I've not written 
that function as yet, but obviously, I'm expecting the user to enter 
some type of number. And we will square that number, and we will reveal 
the answer to that squared number on line 13.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: &lt;div&gt;Answer: { { } }&lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Remember, anything connected to our global scope object will be 
displayed once we use the two pairs of curly braces on line 13. Line 
number 17 has our initialization statements, you've seen this before.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 17 is: let ssApp = angular.module('ssApp' , [ ]) ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So all we really need to do now is get started with our service. But 
before we get started with our service, let's work with the controller 
first of all. So my application will have a controller, I have to give 
that controller a name and a function. So remember well, let's just call
 it CController. And we're going to attach to the second parameter to 
our controller method will have a function, that function in itself will
 take two parameters. The first will be our global scope object, and the
 second will be the service that we're going to be writing. So that 
service itself is actually just a function. So let's create some space 
for a function. This is an anonymous function, obviously, and we will 
define that function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes a code on line 19. The code is: ssApp.controller('CController', function($scope, serviceC){<!-- --></em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to remember on line 12, we have a squareIt 
function. So that squareIt function is now going to be attached to the 
scope object. So squareIt is going to be assigned another function, 
another anonymous function.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes the following code on line 20. The new code is: $scope.squareIt = function() {<!-- --></em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that anonymous function will attempt to use that scope object 
again and we will attach too to the scope object our answer variable. 
Which is appearing on line number 13, so we're going to define that a 
little bit later on. So what I'm saying is that I'm going to use a 
variable called answer to store the return from our service. So serviceC
 is the service, and that service in itself, we will have to attach the 
square function to it or square method. And to that we will pass our 
scope object along with the number that the user is going to type in at 
our HTML element.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes the following code on line 
21: $scope.answer= serviceC .square ($scope.number);. The code on line 
22 is: }. The code on line 23 is: } };</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now that we have all of this in place, I can go ahead and write my
 service. So between lines 24 and 25, let's start writing the service. 
So just like on line 19, we use the controller method, there is a 
service method in AngularJS. There's also a factory method that we could
 have used, but for this demo I'm using a service method. So let's 
attach our service method, and just like the controller method we have 
to pass it. First the name, serviceC and then some kind of anonymous 
function, which is going to do all of the work for us.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 25 is: ssApp.service( ' serviceC' , function() {<!-- --></em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So let's define this function now. So this function, we'll use this 
key word to indicate this particular application. And to that we're 
going to assign to square, the variable called square. We will assign 
that another function. That's going to be another anonymous function, 
but it will accept as a parameter the number that the user has typed in.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 26 is: this.square = function(num1)</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Remember that number is coming in from line 21. So let's define what 
this function is going to do. This function is going to take that num1 
and multiply it by itself and return that value.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 27 is: return (num1 * num1) ;. The code on line 28 is: } ;. The code on line 29 is: } };</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is on line 13 where we have our answer and 
those two pairs of curly braces. We will have to include our answer 
variable that is now attached to the scope object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13. He writes answer in between the double curly brackets.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, let's type 
something like 3, then the square number and you see it's working.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the browser page. In the input box, he types 3. he clicks the Square Number button. Answer displayed is 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's how easy it is to implement services using AngularJS.</p></div>

<h2 id="15a97280-89c1-11e8-9c58-b7993da8b1b4">
Introduction to Vue.js
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Introduction to Vue.js. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we're going to start looking at Vue.js. Vue.js
 is just another framework like AngularJS. However, the file size is 
much smaller. And there are some other features the developers would 
like you to know about Vue.js. But before we get started with Vue.js, 
note that I have an HTML template opened on the left of your screen, and
 that's opened in Notepad++. And then to the right of that is a Chrome 
browser rendering any change I make to that HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The heading on the chrome browser is: VueJS</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So Vue claims that it is smaller in terms of size, file size. And 
they say it's easier to use, it's more versatile. It performs well and 
it is plugable, meaning that you can plug it into any compartment, any 
part of your application, not the entire application. So this leads to 
developers producing more maintainable code. And the code is supposed to
 be more testable, or easier tested. Now, being a front end technology 
mainly, Vue allows developers to encapsulate pieces of a webpage into 
something they call components. So a component really is a combination 
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript dedicated just to that one part of that 
page or that component. So just like AngularJS, we will be using a CDN 
to import the library. So on line 5, I already have a pair of script 
tags. And I'm going to pass to that source attribute the address of 
where we can find our Vue.js library.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the code on line 5, the presenter 
adds a link. The new code on line 5 is: &lt; script src="https: 
//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue . j s"&gt;&lt; /script&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now just to demonstrate how to get started with Vue.js, this is going
 to be a very simple application. We're just going to display a message 
on the browser window. So let's take a look at line 9, where I have a 
div tag id'd so I can target that id, that div tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: &lt; div id="div1"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But between that we have a pair of span tags. And I'm going to be 
using something called interpolation, which is something that we've seen
 before if you had looked at the AngularJS videos. So it's basically two
 pairs of curly braces. And between that, you can pass the value of any 
variable that you wish. So in this case, my variable is called message. 
And that will contain some value that we're going to print between these
 span tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The span tags are present on line 10. The presenter modifies the code on line 10. The new code here is: &lt; span&gt;{<!-- -->{ message }}&lt; /span&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I do have a pair of script tags as well, between lines 12 and 
13. I'm going to make some space between those tags. And I am going to 
declare a variable to hold an instance of my Vue object. Now within that
 Vue object, I'm going to pass or I'm going to develop some type of 
object. So I've got my curly braces there. And what I'm going to be 
doing, the element on the page that I'm targeting is that div tag on 
line 9. So my element is going to be pointing to the pound sign and then
 the name of the element in this case, which is div1. So that will be my
 first property of this particular object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new code on lines 13, 14, and
 15. The code on line 13 is: let ssVue = new Vue({. The code on line 14 
is: el: '#div1'. The code on line 15 is: })</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Then what I'm going to do is make some space for myself, and use a 
comma between properties, and my next property is going to be the data. 
And again, I'm going to use the curly braces to hold the data itself. So
 in this case it's a message, and I'm going to pass some value to that 
message. Something like, Hello from Skillsoft!</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds new codes on lines 15, 16 and
 17. The code on line 15 is: data : (. The code on line 16 is: message :
 'Hello from Skillsoft!'. The succeeding code lines shift 2 lines below.
 The code on line 17 is: }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And so I've got my message, I've got my data component, I've got my 
targeted div tag, and I believe that is all I need. So let's save those 
changes and refresh the browser screen. So I should see this message is 
going to act as a variable. Notice I didn't have to use the scope object
 here. And let's see if this works. I'll refresh the browser screen, and
 there is my message. It is really that easy to use Vue.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The message: Hello from Skillsoft! appears on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if we wanted to do binding, it's just as easy as well. So we will
 use a particular directive called v-bind. And what I'm going to do is 
I'm going to be binding the title of my span tag. And I'm just going to 
remove the interpolation braces here. And I'm going to do something like
 hover, because our title will hold a pop up hover over me. And I think 
that's all I would need. Well, actually I do need to pass my message. So
 I need to let the title know what I'm trying to do. So it will show 
whatever values inside of message. In this case it's going to be Hello 
from Skillsoft!</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 10. The code here is: &lt; span v-bind:title="message"&gt;Hover over me&lt; /span&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Now if I hover,
 notice that the pop up, which is the title, will show up in our pop up 
window there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The message: Hover over me, appears 
on the browser screen. When the presenter moves mouse over this text, 
the previous message, "Hello from Skillsoft!" appears as hover-over 
text.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Something else that is interesting about Vue.js. And in fact most of 
the frameworks is that if I were to let's say access my console and I 
were to change the message. So ssvue.message, notice how IntelliSense 
comes up. And let's assign to that message a new message, something 
like, let's see, Just testing. And I hit the enter key.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> In the console panel of the browser, the presenter types: ssvue.message="Just testing"</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Immediately as I hover over our target, span in this case, notice that the message has changed almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The new hover-over text after the change is Just testing.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div>

Working with Vue.js Projects
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Working with Vue.js projects. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we'll continue with Vue.js and show a typical 
project that includes components. As usual I have an HTML document 
opened to the left of your screen, and to the right of your screen there
 is Chrome rendering that document you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The heading displayed on the browser screen is:VueJS.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML document on the left is opened in Notepad++. And on line 5, 
I'm already pointing to the Vue.js file, which will import that Vue 
library for us, the Vue.js library.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>If you look at line 9, that's a div tag that I've id'ed as demo.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: &lt;div id="demo"&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll be using that div tag to display all of the features that I'm 
going to be talking about in terms of templates and in terms of 
components, in terms of Vue.js components. So let's get started right 
away. So beneath line 11 where my script tag is, I'm going to start 
initializing my Vue component. And well, I've already initialized the 
Vue component on line 13, I'm using the object now, and I'm accessing 
the component method.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: new Vue (( el: '#demo' ));.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to be passing to that component method two things. The 
first thing is the name of the component that I'm going to be using, and
 secondly will be an object. Now, just to explain what we're about to do
 is I'm going to be using the span tag, the HTML span tag as a template,
 as a component. So in other words, once I'm done defining this 
component, this Vue.js component, which is in fact, which is going to 
render in the browser as a span tag. It means I can use that component 
anywhere on this webpage that I need to.</p>
<p>So let's start defining that object. So remember the object itself, 
let's put those curly braces back, the object itself I'm going to use 
the template, the template property. And immediately, I'm going to start
 using the HTML templated strings. Now, don't confuse the HTML templated
 strings with those back ticks on line 13, with the template that I'm 
about to define. So I'm using templated strings because my template on 
line 13 is going to get very long. So the next thing I'm going to do is 
I'm going to include my span tags, the basic HTML span tags. And I'm 
going to put some kind of string between my span tag. So let's say this 
is a template.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares 3 lines of codes on lines
 from 12 to 14. The code on line 12 is: Vue.component('vue-span', {. The
 code on line 13 is: template:`&lt;span&gt;this is a 
template&lt;/span&gt;`. The code on line 14 is: });.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And once I do that I can now access this span tag via its name on 
line 12. The name of the span tag is vue-span. So instead of using the 
regular HTML span, I'm going to use vue-span. So between my div tags on 
line 9, I'm going to start inserting my vue-span, and I'm going to 
complete it with the closing bracket there. I'll save these changes, 
refresh the browser screen, and notice that the span tag operates just 
like a regular HTML span tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 10. 
Succeeding code lines shift one line down. The code on line 10 is: 
&lt;vue-span&gt;&lt;/vue-span&gt;. The presenter saves the file and 
shifts to the browser screen. He refreshes the screen and the following 
text appears below the heading: "this is a template".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But typically, you may want to pass your own value for that where it 
says this is a template, we may want to pass our own value there. So 
what I'm going to do is expand our component on line 13, so I'm going to
 use something called props. And with props, I can define. So on line 
14, I've included props and I'm going to define my props as title. So 
title is going to be used as a variable, and once I do that, well, let's
 put a comma to separate the props from our template. Now once I've done
 that on line 10, I can actually use that title,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 14. The code is: props: ['title'],. Succeeding lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>like this, and pass through it any value that I want.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 10. The new code is: &lt;vue-span title="this is a span tag"&gt;&lt;/vue-span&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is that when vue-span is rendered on the browser, 
it should say this is a span tag rather than this is a template. So if I
 save these changes, refresh the browser screen, well,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The anticipated change doesn't appear on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>actually I need to remove, this is a template first.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on 
line 15 by removing This is a template. The new code on line 15 is: 
template:`&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;`.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then within my span tags itself, I can use those interpolated 
strings. Remember, they go in between the two pairs of curly braces. And
 I can now display that title like this.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He again modifies the code on line 15, the new code is: template:`&lt;span&gt;{<!-- -->{title}}&lt;/span&gt;`.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 15, I've inserted the interpolated strings with my title 
in there. I'll save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and now 
it says, this is a span tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen the text below the heading changes to: "this is a span tag".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I was successful in passing a value from my title on line 10 into the rendered version of this span tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the code on line 10 and then points to the result displayed on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But let's do more. Actually now, let's declare a function, so that 
this function will return data. So let's use data as the property, and 
point it to a function. That function will be defined as returning an 
object, all function must return objects. So return, return an object. 
And let's return in that object something, another variable if you want 
to consider it a variable. So it's count, and for now I'll just pass the
 value of 0.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines from 16 to
 20. The succeeding codes shift 5 lines down. The code on line 16 is: 
data:function(){. The code on line 17 is: return {. The code on line 18 
is: count : 0. The code on line 19 is: }. The code on line 20 is }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, within my span tags I can, let's make some, well actually, let's
 copy what we have before and paste it. But instead of title, let's now 
display count.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 15, the new code is: template:`&lt;span&gt;{<!-- -->{title}}{<!-- -->{count}}&lt;/span&gt;`.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just that simple change, let's save our work, refresh the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the text below the heading disappears.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I made a mistake in that I need to separate these two properties.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He places a , at the end of the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save that again, refresh the browser screen, and there's my 0.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the text below the heading changes to: "this is a span tag 0".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we can even take this a little bit further. Let's put our title 
and countdown to the next line. And next to my span tag, well, within my
 span tag of my template I am going to use another directive, v-on, the 
v-on directive. And pass to that the mouseover event. And I'm going to 
assign to that mouseover event a function as count++.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He breaks the code on line 15. The following part of the code shifts to line 16: {<!-- -->{title}}{<!-- -->{count}}&lt;/span&gt;`,. He then modifies the code on line 15, the new code is: template:`&lt;span v-on:mouseover="count++"&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and now, whenever I hover over that tag, the count changes.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The result on the browser screen is: 
this a span tag 0. Every time the presenter hovers the mouse over this 
result, the number in the result changes. Currently, the number is 7. 
Hence the result is: this is a span tag 7.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But I started by saying that I can use these components anywhere I 
want, so let's copy line 10, let's copy that line, the entire line, and 
paste it again. And I can actually pass a different title, so this is 
another span tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter copies the code on line
 10 and pastes it on line 11. He then modifies the code on line 11: The 
new code is: &lt;vue-span title="this is another span 
tag"&gt;&lt;/vue-span&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll save these changes, refresh the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the text below the heading changes to: "this is a span tag 0 this is another span tag 0".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Well, let's put a break tag between them so it's a little bit easier to see.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He adds a break tag at the end of the
 code on line 10, the new code is: &lt;vue-span title="this is a span 
tag"&gt;&lt;/vue-span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save these changes, refresh the browser screen. Notice we have two span tags now.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the text below
 the heading appears in two lines now. The first line is: "this is a 
span tag 0". The second line is: "this is another span tag 0".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, when I move the mouse over the first span tag it changes and I 
can keep doing that forever. Now, I'm going to move my mouse over the 
second span tag. And notice that they are operating independent of each 
other. So that's the power of Vue components.</p></div>

Vue.js Standard Directives
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Vue.js Standard Directives. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we will continue with Vue.js. As usual, I have
 an HTML document open on the left of your screen, it's opened in 
Notepad++. On the right of your screen, there's Chrome rendering that 
document you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, some text is 
visible. First, VueJS is written in bold letters as a heading, and below
 that the following is written: {<!-- -->{}}.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've gone ahead on line 5 and I have attached the Vue.js library to this HTML document via CDN.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 13, I have initialized a new application, a Vue.js application or app, and I've named it ssApp.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: let ssApp = new Vue(.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I've also gone ahead and targeted a particular div tag in this case, 
it's on line 9, there's a div tag. And we are now binding that div tag 
to our ssApp application on line 13.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: &lt;div id= "ssApp"&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Also, I have a data structure where I have one variable called x, and
 there's a value associated with that x called Hello from Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He refers to the code lines 16 and 17. The code here is: data:{. The code on line 17 is: x: "Hello from skillsoft".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 10 you see those interpolation characters again, which sometimes called the mustache.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 10 is: {()}.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And if I were to pass my x in there, save the changes, refresh the 
browser screen, you see that the value that's in x is now displayed as a
 result of the interpolation.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 10, the 
new code is: {(x)}. After refreshing the browser, the text on the 
browser page changes to: "Hello from Skillsoft".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But this video, this demonstration, is about directives. And 
directives are really just small execution commands that can be attached
 to DOM elements. So essentially, a directive is a special command that 
tells the Vue.js library to do something to a particular element. And in
 this case, we're working with the div tag on line 8.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter is referring to the div tag on line 9.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Some of the most common ones are v-if, v-else, and v-show. All of 
these directives start with the v-. So my first example, I'm going to 
use something called v-text. And for that, I've just made some space and
 I'm going to use line 11. And what I'm going to do on line 11 is I'm 
going to start typing a span tag. And I'm going to use that span tag to 
show you how the v-text works. So as an attribute of my span tag, I am 
going to now issue a directive, v-text. And I'm going to pass to that 
v-text directive the value of x. Well, let's leave both of them for now 
and let's save these changes,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 11, 
previous codes from line 11 onward shift one line down. The new code on 
line 11 is: &lt;span v-text="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>refresh the browser screen, and notice that I get two Hello from Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The text on the browser page changes again. The new text is: "Hello from Skillsoft Hello from Skillsoft".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm going to remove the first one on line x, that's your interpolation, I'll remove that.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> After removing the code fron line 10, the succeding code lines shift one line up.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Save the changes, refresh the browser screen, and there's your Hello from Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The text on the second line on the browser page changes back to: "Hello from Skillsoft".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But there are several more directives we can use. Let's use the 
v-html. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy line 10 and I'm 
going to paste it at line 11. So now I've got two span tags between my 
div tag that is bound to my application. I'm going to use a different 
variable here. So let's use y, and remember this is going to be v-html, 
so html.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter modifies the code on line 11. The new code is: &lt;span v-html="y"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I'm going to have to create another data point, so let's put a 
comma on line 18. And actually, what I'm going to do is just copy and 
paste. So I'm going to copy line 18 and paste it to line 19. And 
remember, we're using a different variable, so let's use y in this case.
 I'll remove the comma from the end of Hello from Skillsoft. And 
basically, what this does, v-html, as you might imagine, it produces 
pure HTML. So this variable, y, will send pure HTML to that span tag on 
line 11. So the first thing that I'm going to do to demonstrate this is 
issue the break tag. And just to show you exactly how it works, I'm 
going to use another break tag between from and Skillsoft. So let's use 
another break tag there. And let's do Skillsoft 2 so we know it's a 
different value here for my data point y.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the codes on lines 18 and
 19. The new code on line 18 is: x: "Hello from skillsoft",. The new 
code on line 19 is: y: "&lt;br/&gt;Hello from &lt;br/&gt;skillsoft 2".</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen. And immediately
 you saw that the second value is now placed on the line below the first
 one. Also, Skillsoft is now placed on the third line, meaning that it 
has abided by the break tag.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, two more text 
lines are added. The text on line 2 is: Hello from, and the text on line
 3 is: Skillsoft 2.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'll demonstrate one more, but I'm going to use a div tag for this. 
So let's use a div tag here. And I'll close off my div tag. And in this 
case, I have to actually insert something and I'll show you why. So 
let's insert Hello from Skillsoft between my div tags. And let's make 
this 3 so we know it's a totally different sentence. However, my div is 
going to have a directive of v-show. And I'm going to make that equal to
 yet another variable, so let's use z in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12, the new code is: &lt;div v-show="z"&gt;Hello from skillsoft 3&lt;/div&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And once again, I'm going to copy one of my previous data points on 
line 19, let's say. And well, actually, let's copy, yeah, 19 is fine. 
Actually, we don't need to pass it any strings. We just need to pass it 
the value of false or true. So let's remove the comma, but place another
 comma on line 20. So my data structure now has a third element, which 
is sort of like a Boolean element, and or a Boolean data point. And so 
our z will be, I need to change this as well. So x, y, z, I need to 
change this one here on line 21, this should be z. So I have three 
different data points.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The presenter places a comma at the 
end of the code on line 20, the new code is: y: "&lt;br/&gt;Hello from 
&lt;br/&gt;skillsoft 2",. He also declares a code on line 21, the 
previous codes on line 21 onward shift one down. The new code on line 21
 is: z: false</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, obviously, the way this is going to work is that if z is false, 
the content between our div tag will not show up on the browser page.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights "Hello from skillsoft 3" in the code line 12.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But if I change this to true, then you'll see a third line here. So 
let's save these changes, refresh the browser screen, and nothing is 
going to happen because that's what we expected. Let's hit F12 on the 
keyboard to get to my console. Let's access my app, my ssApp, and let's 
access our z data point and make that equal to true. So it was false 
before. Now take a look at the browser screen as I hit the Enter key. I 
hit the Enter key, notice immediately, Hello from Skillsoft shows up on 
the browser's screen. So that's the power of using directives from 
Vue.js.</p></div>

React Basics
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: React Basics. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I'm going to start looking at ReactJS. ReactJS
 is another JavaScript library. As usual, I have an HTML document opened
 in Notepad++ and this is located to the left of your screen. But to the
 right of that screen is a Chrome browser, and that will render any 
changes that I make to the HTML document on the left of your screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser page, the following text is present: React JS.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>React is another JavaScript library, and it can be used to update web
 pages. In fact, it can even be used on the server side as well. ReactJS
 plays nicely with Angular and Vue, or it can be used in place of those 
two. What makes React a little bit different from the other two is that 
it uses a special syntax called JSX, and with that special syntax, what 
that syntax tends to do is that it tends to sort of concatenate 
JavaScript and HTML together. So this sort of eliminates the need for 
physical files, a separation of concerns. And also, it helps to build 
components a little bit easier. And it even prevents certain types of 
injection attacks. So just like with AngularJS and VueJS, we need to 
import certain libraries, and as you can see, between lines 5 and 7, I 
already have some script tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: &lt;script 
src=" "&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. The code on line 6 is: &lt;script src=" 
"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. The code on line 7 is: &lt;script src=" 
"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So it is a Facebook, actually, it was produced and developed at 
Facebook. So we will get the library, the main ReactJS library, from 
Facebook. But there's also another library that we need, which is the 
ReactDOM library.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the code line 5, he adds the following text between the double quotes: https://fb.me/react-0 .14 .3 .js</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've just inserted these two libraries on lines 5 and 6.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the code line 6, he adds the following text between the double quotes: https://fb.me/react-dom-0 .14 .3 .js.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I did say that React uses JSX. However, the browser does not 
understand JSX. So we need some way, some mechanism, of converting that 
JSX into plain old HTML or plain old JavaScript. So for that, we're 
going to use something called Babel. And I'm going to insert that 
library on line 7.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the code line 7, he adds the 
following text between the double quotes: 
https://unpkg.com/babe1-standalone@6.15.0/babe1.min.js</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So, there you go, line 7, we've reported the Babel library. So we 
have everything that we need now to start writing plain old React, 
right? So we'll start with a very simple example of just sending some 
HTML code off to the browser screen. But in order to do that, we would 
need a target. So if you notice on line 7, I do have, actually line 11, I
 have a div tag there.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we'll use that as the target. So let's give it an ID. So I'm going
 to give it an ID of root and so back to this Babel thing now,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 11 and modifies it. The new code is: &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>where I have those script tags, the JavaScript tags, we have to 
actually let the browser know that we are using this special syntax. So I
 have to add an attribute to my script tags. So it's not just script 
alone. We have to tell it that we are using this Babel, what's called a 
transpilator.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 12 and 
then highlights the codes on line 12 and 13. The code on line 12 is: 
&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;. The code on line 13 is: 
&lt;/script&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So we are transpilating our JSX code into plain old HTML and 
JavaScript. So once that's done, we can actually tap into the library 
now, and because we are going to be using the render method, we need the
 main object, which is ReactDOM, and we can access from that the render 
method. And once we have that render method, then we can pass to it two 
parameters. The first parameter, let's make some space. The first 
parameter can be HTML if you want. So in this case, I do have a pair of 
span tags in there, and I can even pass some text directly from this 
render method. My second parameter will be the target on this page. So 
it's, say, a plain old JavaScript now, it says the 
document.getElementById, and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He writes a code on line 15. The code is: document.getElementByID ( ' root ')</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>we'll pass in the name of the element that we're targeting, root in this case.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines from 13 to
 16. the code on line 13 is: ReactDOM. render (. The code on line 14 is:
 &lt;span&gt;Hello from Skillsoft&lt;/span&gt;, . The code on line 15 
is: document.getElementByID ( ' root ')The code on line 16 is: );</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And this is about the simplest React application you can find. Let's 
save all of those changes, refresh the browser screen, and we should now
 see that span tag displayed on the browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser screen: Hello from Skillsoft.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And that's just how easy it is to start using React.</p></div>

Working with React Components
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: Working with React Components. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we'll continue with ReactJS and we'll look at 
some of the key concepts of what they're calling reactive programming. 
What I have on the screen is an HTML document opened in Notepad++ on the
 left. And on the right, that is Chrome rendering the document you see 
on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the chrome browser screen, the 
following text is present as a heading in bold letters: React JS. Below 
the heading, the following text is present: Hello from Skillsoft.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML document to the left of your screen already has the 
libraries imported between lines 5 and 7. Those would be the React 
libraries that you can get from Facebook. On line 11, there's a div tag 
with an id of root, and we'll be targeting that div tag to display some 
of the changes that we're going to be making.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Between lines 12 and 24, that's our script area and we will be 
writing, we will be changing that script as I go on. So this is about 
the key concepts. However, the ReactJS is extremely huge, it is a big 
library. And so I've attempted to pull out some of the main concepts of 
that library. In fact, in order to get started with ReactJS, you need to
 know certain things like JSX, what is that? The components, props and 
data binding, and that there's also something called a Virtual DOM. 
These are all sort of a big part of ReactJS. What you're looking at on 
the screen between lines 13 and 22 is JSX. It is sort of a combination 
of JavaScript and HTML. Take a look at line 15. Line 15 is returning 
pure HTML. But it's doing that via JavaScript.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: return &lt;p&gt;Hello from Skillsoft &lt;/p&gt;;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, you do not have to use JSX. You can use plain JavaScript. 
However, what the developers, what Facebook is saying, is that if you 
use JSX, then writing code is much easier. You become a little bit more 
productive. Another concept that I'd like to bring across is the concept
 of components. Everything in ReactJS is a component. On line 13, we 
have started creating our own component called Greet.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 13 is: class Greet extends React . Component {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And as you can see, we are returning HTML. So all components have to 
return HTML. And it is a combination of these small components that can 
actually build a real web page. But getting back to GSX itself, it 
allows us to use something called props in order to pass another concept
 props. It allows us to pass variables from one part of the application 
to another. So if we take a look at line 12, I can actually within my 
render method, I can actually create a variable. Let's call it ss for 
this case. And we will give it some value, let's say we wanted to give 
it the value of Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: &lt;script 
type="text/babel"&gt;. The presenter goes to the code on line 20, the 
code is: &lt;Greet /&gt;,. He then modifies the code on line 20, the new
 code is: &lt;Greet ss="Skillsoft" /&gt;,.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>It means now that in my return statement on line 15, I could remove 
that Skillsoft word and include a pair of curly braces. And within that 
curly braces, I can access the current component, which is Greet. It can
 access the property of that component and then attach to that the 
variable that I just created on line 20, which is ss.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He then modifies the code on line 15. The new code is: return &lt;p&gt;Hello from { this .props .ss} &lt;/p&gt;;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>With these changes, all I have to do is save the changes, refresh the
 browser's screen, and you'll notice that nothing changes on the 
browser.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He highlights the text on the browser screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is a way of passing props, is a way of passing variables from
 one part of the application to another. Along with props is something 
called data binding. So let's take a look at line 11 where I have that 
div tag or original div tag. I'm going to create another div tag 
underneath it. So on line 12, I've inserted a div tag. I'm going to give
 it a second id, so let's call it id root.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code on line 11. He 
then declares a code on line 12. The code is: &lt;div 
id="root2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. The succeeding code lines shift one line 
down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And what I'm going to do is, I will use that second div tag to show a
 clock. I'm going to create my own clock here. So what I'm going to do 
now is create a function so lets say around line 24, 25, I'm going to 
create a function called seconds. And I'm going to define what that 
function is. So first of all I will declare constant, and it's going to 
be some type of element, that element is going to be a paragraph tag, so
 it's another paragraph tag. While I'm working with this second 
function, I'm going to pass to it some more values. So I've already 
passed the It is, weâ€™re just like a constant, but I'm also going to use 
now plain old JavaScript Date object. That new Date will give me a new 
date. And I'm going to convert that new Date to the local time string, 
whatever that happens to be in the region.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines from 25 to
 30. The code on line 25 is: function seconds ( ) {. The code on line 26
 is: const element = (. The code on line 27 is: &lt;p&gt;It is { new 
Date ( ) . toLocaleTimeString ( ) } . &lt;/p&gt;. The code on line 28 
is: ) ;. The code on line 29 is: / /. The code on line 30 is }. The 
succeeding code lines shift six lines down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now remember, this is about binding so I'm going to actually create 
another React, ReactDOM.render method. So we already have one on line 
20.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 20 is: ReactDOM . render (.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>I'm not going to use that one, I'm going to create another one. So on
 line 30, I'll create another ReactDOM.render method. Remember that 
render method takes two parameters. The first parameter will be the 
element that I just created on line 25. And the second parameter to that
 render method will be the target ID on the webpage, which is at line 
12, so that's root2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines from 30 to
 33. The code on line 30 is: ReactDOM . render (. The code on line 31 
is: element ,. The code on line 32 is: document . getElementById 
('root2'). The code on line 33 is: ) ;. The succeeding code lines shift 
four lines down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>After that, all I really need to do is use plain old JavaScript 
again, the setInterval method. I'm going to pass it two parameters. The 
first is the function that I created on line 25. And the second is the 
amount of seconds I want to have or milliseconds in this case, I want to
 have passed after I call that seconds function on line 25.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares code on line 36, the code is: setInterval (seconds, 1000) ;. The succeeding code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with these changes, let's save the changes, refresh the browser 
screen. And we should now see the time and it's actually ticking off in 
terms of seconds.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the current 
time is displayed. The time is moving forward. It shows hours, minutes 
and seconds. The time is written as It is 2:17:51 PM.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's data binding, but that's one way to do data binding with 
React JS. Now the last concept that I wanted to talk about is something 
called the virtual DOM. Now, it'll be really difficult to demonstrate 
the virtual DOM, but I can tell you that React JS is faster because of 
the virtual DOM. And as the words suggest, what it is is an in-memory 
representation of the DOM. So with the virtual DOM, the real DOM is 
never really touched. Updating the real dump in real life, well in a 
normal sense, would include parsing HTML, updating the CSS, changing the
 parent and child elements, updating the layouts.</p>
<p>And even traversing the render tree and finally painting all of that 
image onto the browser. But with the virtual DOM, the virtual DOM is 
constantly monitoring the HTML document for changes and they use some 
kind of differential algorithm. In fact, it's called the diff algorithm.
 And so whenever there needs to be an update, what the virtual DOM does 
is only update that part of the image. So the entire page doesn't have 
to be recreated or the entire page does not have to be affected, only 
those parts of the page. So that's why React JS is a little bit faster, 
and that's why React JS is so popular.</p></div>

React and JSX
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic title: React and JSX. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we will continue with React.js and we'll look 
at embedding expressions with JSX. Once again, I have an HTML template 
opened on the left of your screen, that's opened up in Notepad++. On the
 right of your screen, there's a Chrome browser rendering the HTML you 
see on the left and we will be making changes to that HTML document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the chrome browser screen, the 
following text is present as a heading in bold letters: React JS. Below 
the heading, the following text is present: Hello from Skillsoft.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>As of right now, we do have some script tags between lines 13 and 25 
that will change. And between lines 5 and 7, I have gone ahead and 
connected to the various libraries that we've been using throughout the 
series. Also, on the HTML document I have two div tags already ID'ed as 
root1 and root2 on lines 11 and 12, respectively. We will be using those
 div tags to display content from our JSX code.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. The code on line 12 is: &lt;div id="root2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The code that I have on the screen right now you may have seen in 
another example. On line 14, I have a class, it's called Greet, which is
 essentially a component.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 14 is: class Greet extends React . Component {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That component is returning, on line 16, a mixture of variables and a placeholder for content.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 16 is: return &lt;p&gt;Hello from { this .props .ss} &lt;/p&gt;;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So think of anything inside of those braces as a placeholder for the 
values of variables that we will work out eventually. Actually, on line 
20, we are actually working out what that variable is supposed to be. 
The variable is called ss and it has a value of Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 20 is: ReactDOM . render (.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on lines 21 and 22, what we're saying is that we're going to 
access the route element, which is on line 11, but we'll pass to that 
root element a value, which happens to be Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 21 is: &lt;Greet ss="Skillsoft" /&gt;,. The code on line 22 is: document . getElementById ('root').</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 16 when that entire statement is printed out on a browser 
screen, we're not going to get Hello from and then open curly braces, 
we're going to get whatever this.props.ss works out to be, in this case 
it's Skillsoft. So on the Chrome browser, what you're seeing is, Hello 
from Skillsoft. Which is this.props.ss being evaluated and returning 
Skillsoft. So to take this example a little bit further, between lines 
13 and 14 I will make some space there and I will insert a constant, the
 name of that variable will be country, and I'm going to apply some 
value to it. So let's put a value inside of country.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 14. The code is: const country = ' Canada ' ;. The succeeding code lines shift one line down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, on line 17, I can now perform concatenation just like in regular
 JavaScript. So I will concatenate what we have already, well, in this 
case, it's going to be a space. And then I will concatenate that with 
another variable, which we just declared on line 14 and initialized.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 17. The new code is: return &lt;p&gt;Hello from { this .props .ss + ' ' + country } &lt;/p&gt;;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with just that simple change, if I save these changes, refresh the
 browser screen, now it's going to say, Hello from Skillsoft Canada.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the following text appears below the heading: Hello from Skillsoft Canada.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's another way to work with these placeholders, these curly 
braces. But, you know, most time we won't have a component declared on 
line 15. Most times, just to get something done really quickly, we may 
just want to declare some type of HTML and have that pass over to the 
render method. So between lines 14 and 15, I'm going to declare another 
constant, el in this case, short for element. And I'm going to assign 
just plain old HTML. In this case, it's going to be a header 3 tag and 
I'm going to pass to it Hello. And within this element that I'm 
declaring, I'm going to place my placeholder. So within the element 
itself, you can say that within the variable itself, we can actually 
pass another variable, which is the variable country that we declared on
 line 14.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares a code on line 15. The 
code is: const el = &lt;h3&gt;Hello, { country } &lt;/h3&gt;;. The 
succeeding code lines shift one line down. .</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with my new constant el, in this case on line 15, I can go ahead 
and push that off to the second div tag that I have on line 12. But for 
that I'll need a second ReactDOM.render method. So let's put that on 
line 27. So I'm going to create another render method and I'm going to 
pass to it two, it always takes two parameters. So the first one will be
 the element itself. And a second will be the target. So in this case 
it's document.getElementById. And remember, that second element is 
root2.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines 27, 28, 
and 29. The code on line 27 is: ReactDOM . render (. The code on line 28
 is: el , document . getElementById('root2'). The code on line 29 is: ) 
;. The succeeding code lines shift three lines down.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So with that in place, I can save these changes, refresh the browser 
screen. And we should get a second statement at the bottom of Hello from
 Canada. Just Hello, Canada, because that's what we had in our variable 
that we declared on line 15.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> On the browser screen, the following 
text appears below the original result: Hello, Canada. The new result is
 written in bold letters in large font size. He then shifts to the html 
file and highlights the code on line 15.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Now, I've been passing strings, but just keep in mind that we can 
also pass arithmetic expressions as well. So this is the way embedded 
expressions work with JSX and React JS.</p></div>

Virtual DOM
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Virtual DOM. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we will continue with ReactJS, and we'll take a
 look at updating elements on an HTML page using the React virtual DOM. 
There are two applications opened. On the left of your screen, there's 
an HTML document opened in Notepad++, and to the right of that, a Chrome
 browser is rendering that HTML document you see on the left of your 
screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text is present on the browser screen like a heading: React JS.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Let's focus on the HTML document, and on lines 5, 6, and 7, I have 
created script tags to access the various libraries of ReactJS.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: &lt;script 
src=" https://fb.me/react-0 .14 .3 .js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. The code on 
line 6 is: &lt;script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-0 .14 .3 .js 
"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. The code on line 7 is: &lt;script src=" 
https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On line 11, I have a div tag that I've id'ed as root. We'll be using that div tag as a target to pass to it</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 11 is: &lt;div id = "root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>various HTML tags that I'm going to be developing using ReactJS. I've
 got script tags between lines 12 and 13, and we will be writing our 
code in there, our JSX code, as well as JavaScript code.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 12 is: &lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And we can now get started. Let's get started with declaring an 
element, so I can use const or I can use let. I'll give my element a 
name, so I'll use el for short, and I can pass to it pure HTML. So I can
 say that I want to have my element pass over a pair of h3 tags, let's 
say. I could pass the closing tag as well. As well as between those 
tags, I can pass the exact phrase that I want to have shown on the 
browser screen.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He types the following code on line 13. The code is: const el = &lt;h3&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h3&gt;;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And once I have that all set up, I can now go ahead and include my 
ReactDOM object, and I can access from that object the render method. If
 you have seen my previous videos, you know that the render method takes
 two parameters, so that's why there's a comma there on line 16.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 15 is: ReactDOM.render (</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The first parameter would be whatever HTML I want to have passed to 
the document. So in this case, it's the element that I created on line 
13, which is labeled as el. So el represents that entire h3 tag along 
with the content of that tag. But to the right of it, it will be, I have
 to specify to the application where I want to have this Hello, world 
appear with the tags. So I want to have it appear on line 11, where my 
root tag is, so it's a div tag with the ID of root. So I'm going to say,
 I'm going to access my document.getElementById, and that particular 
element is labeled as root.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 16 is: el , document.getElementById( ' root ' )</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I have everything that I need in place to be able to pass Hello, 
world onto my browser screen. So let's save the changes, refresh the 
browser screen, and we should see Hello, world there shortly.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears below the heading on the browser screen in bold letters: Hello, world.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But there is another way to do this. Instead of passing the entire 
HTML element and content, I could actually access the React object and</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 13 and highlights the following text from the code: &lt;h3&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h3&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>the createElement method of that object.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code line 13. The new code is: const el = React.createElement ;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now my constant el represents the createElement object. Once I 
have that, let's turn our attention to the render method on line 15. The
 second part of that method will remain the same because I'm targeting 
the same div tag on line 11, the root div tag. So let's push that down 
to the next line, and remember,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 16. After el,, he shifts the remaining code to line 17.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>my el now becomes a method. So let's pass to that el, the stuff that I
 want to have show up on the screen. So let's, first of all, pass a 
container, and that's a div container. Notice I'm not using the angle 
brackets. Now, the second element would be, if I wanted to update 
something on that div tag, now, I don't have anything to update at this 
point, so I'll pass null for my second parameter. My third parameter, 
however, is the content that I want to have displayed. So in this case, 
it's going to be, Hello from Skillsoft.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code on line 16, the new code is:el('div' ,null, 'Hello from Skillsoft'),</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So as you can see, I'm telling the React.createElement method that I 
want to use a div tag, and I want to pass this content into that div 
tag. And that would be it. I'll save my changes, refresh the browser 
screen, and now we should see Hello from Skillsoft wrapped into plain 
old div tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The text below the heading on the browser screen changes to: Hello from Skillsoft. Now, the letters are not in bold.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that's two different ways, so there are two different ways to pass HTML to the virtual DOM using ReactJS libraries.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 id="261c9160-89c1-11e8-9c58-b7993da8b1b4">
Exercise: Creating a Vue.js Application
</h2>
<div><p>[Video description begins] <em> Topic Title: Exercise: Creating a Vue.js Application. Your host for this session is Axle Barr.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>In this exercise, we will work with Vue.js. You will create a Vue.js 
component with the following specifications. Use an HTML tag with an 
attribute. That attribute will act as a placeholder for content. Develop
 a Vue.js component and pass to that attribute content, HTML content. 
Use a data structure, and also enhance the HTML with rich content. You 
may now pause the video, develop this exercise on your own. But return 
to the video to see how I would work with this exercise.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> A solution banner appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>On the left of your screen, there's an HTML document with a template,
 HTML template, opened in Notepad++. And I'm going to be using that to 
develop the exercise. To the right of that is Chrome. Chrome is 
rendering the document you see on the left.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text is present on the browser screen: Vue.js Components.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>The HTML document, the template, already has on line 5 a link to the Vue.js library.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 5 is: &lt;script src="https: //cdn. jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.j s"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I will use that to develop my Vue.js component. But the first 
thing the exercise asked us to do is to include some HTML tags which we 
can target via our component. So let's develop, between lines 9 and 10, 
I'll include some div tags there. I'll give it an id, let's called it 
myContent. So our component can now target this area of the HTML 
document.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 9 is: &lt;div id="myContent"&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But we're not done yet, we also need some paragraph tags. So I've 
included on line 10 a paragraph tag, an opening paragraph tag, and now a
 closing paragraph tag. Between those paragraph tags, if you remember, 
with Vue.js, it does require a pair of curly braces, two pairs of curly 
braces. So between those paragraph tags, I'm going to include a pair of 
curly braces, two pairs of curly braces. And I'm also going to give it 
some kind of title, so, I can use that as my placeholder for content 
that I'm going to develop shortly.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The code on line 10 is: &lt;p&gt; {<!-- -->{content}}&lt;/p&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this HTML document already has some script tags on lines 12 and 
13. So we'll be using that to develop our Vue.js component. So let's 
make some space between 12 and 13, and I'm going to use a regular 
JavaScript variable, just call it v in this case. And I'll point that to
 the Vue.js constructor. So my first data structure will be el, and I'll
 be using that el to point it to the myContent div tag on line 9.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes on lines 13 to 15. 
The code on line 13 is: let v = new Vue({. The code on line 14 is: el: 
"#myContent",. The code on line 15 is }).</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So that first part, line 14 is now saying that we're going to target 
this particular area. Now there's a comma there, so the second part of 
this component will be the data structure. So, for now, I'm going to use
 curly braces again, and I'm going to use content, followed by whatever 
content I need to pass to that paragraph tag on line 10. So my content 
is going to be a sentence, so it's Skillsoft develops technology. Now I 
have to concatenate this because it's going to run off the side of the 
page. So let's use a concatenation character, and I'm going to complete 
on line 17 my sentence that I need to pass to that paragraph tag on line
 10. So Skillsoft develops technology and business courses.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He declares codes from line 15 to 18.
 The code on line 15 is: data : {. The code on line 16 is: content: 
"Skillsoft develops technology " +. The code on line 17 is: "and busines
 courses". The code on line 18 is: }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>That would be all I need, I can save these changes, refresh the 
browser screen. And as you can see, I'm able to use my components and 
pass some content over to the paragraph tags.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the browser screen: Skillsoft develops technology and busiues courses</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But the exercise asked us to pass rich content. So rich content could
 actually just be passing a pair of strong tags over to the paragraph 
tag. So let's take a look at line 17. I want to make and strong, so I 
want to bold the word and.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He modifies the code line 17. The new code is: "&lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;busines courses"</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So I've included some strong tags, some HTML strong tags there. Let's
 save these changes, refresh the browser screen. And as you can see we 
are printing the strong tags with the rest of the content,</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the screen: Skillsoft develops technology &lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;busines courses.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>that's not what we need. So in order to fix this we're going to have 
to change the p tag on line 10. We need to now include something called 
the v-html attribute and, or directive, and we'll assign to it content. 
So the same content that I have between the two pairs of curly braces, 
let's remove it from there. And place it inside of the quotes next to 
v-html directive.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> He goes to the code line 10 and modifies it. The new code is: &lt;p v-html="content"&gt; {<!-- -->{}}&lt;/p&gt;</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And with just that simple change, let's save everything, refresh the 
browser screen, and now, and is bolded, and that is exactly what we were
 looking for.</p>
<p>[Video description begins] <em> The following text appears on the 
screen: Skillsoft develops technology and busines courses. The word 
"and" appears in bold letters.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So this is an example of using Vue.js component and passing rich 
content, rich HTML over to some target area within the HTML document.</p></div>
