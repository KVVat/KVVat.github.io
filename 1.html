Displaying Time with JavaScript in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
JavaScript provides a powerful toolkit, full of different functions. One
 function that can be very useful is the time object, which allows you 
to access and display a system's time. With it, we can provide feedback 
for the user or even place a real-time clock on the screen. So in this 
video, I'll explain how to display time using JavaScript. Okay, so I've 
already set up a button called <strong>Show Time</strong> and when it's clicked, we're going to run a function called <code>"displayTime()"</code>. And I've set up an <code>"output"</code> id here, <code>span</code>, that we can use to pass information back to the page. So I'm going to start with <code>script</code> <code>type="text/javascript"</code> and then our <code>function</code>, which is <code>displayTime()</code>, like that. Now the way we create date object is to use <code>new</code> <code>Date</code>. And I'm going to start a variable called <code>now = new</code> <code>Date();</code>
 like that. Make sure you use the opening and closing parentheses. And 
I'm going to add a line here...actually rather than a line, I'll just 
say <code>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML</code>, we'll 
actually put it to the screen. I was going to try an alert, but this is 
better because we can actually see it pop up on the screen, equals <code>now</code>. And if I <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and <strong>Show Time</strong>,
 we get a nice sort of indication of the day, and year, and the time, 
and even the time zone. So that's really useful. But what if you wanted 
to drill down a bit? Well, it's easy to do. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag. The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;button onclick="displayTime()"&gt;Show Time&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;span id="output"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>In
 the head section, the presenter adds the opening and closing script 
tags in separate lines of code. The opening script tag reads "&lt;script
 type="text/javascript"&gt;". He creates the displayTime() function as 
follows:<br>function displayTime()<br> {<!-- --><br> now = new Date();<br> document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = now;<br>}<br>The
 presenter refreshes the web page and clicks the Show Time button in it.
 This displays the current day, date, time, and time zone below the 
button.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So what we're going to do is say <code>month = now.getMonth();</code>. 
By the way, you'll see there is a lot of information that you can pull 
from that date object, so that's all the different information that you 
can pull. We're going to choose <code>getMonth</code>, <code>day = now.get</code>...make sure you put the opening and closing parentheses otherwise it's not going to work. The <code>day = now.getDay()</code>, <code>year = now.get</code>...now you can use <code>getYear</code> or <code>getFullYear</code>. There is <code>getYear</code>, <code>getFullYear</code> will give you the full year, so we want that...and again parentheses...and <code>time = now.getTime();</code>. Now once I've done that, I'm going to go ahead and use <code>document.getElementById</code> again and the <code>("output")</code> container and <code>.innerHTML</code> equals...I'm going to be using <code>+=</code> because we want to add to the date object that we added up there. We're going to start with couple of line breaks and then <code>+ "month: " + month + </code>"<code> day: "</code>...make sure we put a space in there...<code>+ day + </code>"<code> year: " + year + </code>and then finally, <code>" time: " + time;</code>. <br>
<em>In the displayTime() function, the presenter types the code "month =
 now.get" and a datalist with various options appears. The options 
include getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMilliseconds, and 
getMonth. He clicks the getMonth option and the code is automatically 
set as "month = now.getMonth();". In a similar way, he adds the 
following code to the displayTime() function:<br>day = now.getDay();<br>year= now.getFullYear();<br>time = now.getTime();<br>Then,
 to display the output, the presenter types the code 
"document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += '&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;' +
 "month: " + month + " day: " + day + " year: " + year + " time: " + 
time;".</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now when I <strong>Save</strong> this and <strong>Refresh</strong> our page and then click <strong>Show Time</strong>,
 what we have is not exactly what we were expecting. Okay, we do have 
correct information here. The month is "month: 4", which is actually 
correct, okay. May is the 5th month, but actually when you consider this
 starts at 0, that's correct; "day: 3", well, it's not the third, it's 
the seventh, but day is actually the day of the week, okay, so it's the 
fourth day of the week. Remember, 0 is the first value. The year we got 
right because we used <code>getFullYear</code>. And then this is totally
 out of whack. And the reason for that is I'm going to put a little 
comment in here about time because this is something you've to be aware 
of; <code>// time is the number of milliseconds</code>, this is an interesting little fact that you can use to impress your friends, <code>since midnight January 1, 1970</code>.
 So according to JavaScript, that's the number of milliseconds that have
 passed since midnight January 1st, 1970. So you're going to have to do a
 little bit of math to figure out exactly what time it is using that 
feature. But if I put in additional one in here, let's go ahead and put <code>getDate</code>. So <code>date =</code>, lowercase d <code>date</code>, that should work, it's <code>now.getDate</code>. Okay, and then here we're going to put <code>" date: " + date</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks 
the Show Time button. In addition to the information regarding the 
current day, date, time, and time zone, the following information is 
displayed:<br>Month: 4 day: 3 year: 2014 time: 1399477398405<br>Since 
the time is shown in milliseconds, the presenter adds a comment above 
the code "time = now.getTime();". The comment reads "// time is the 
number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970". Next, to 
display the current date as an output on the web page, he types the code
 "date = now.getDate;" below the code "day = now.getDay();". Then, to 
display the date, he modifies the code for displaying the output as 
follows:<br> document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += 
'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;' + "month: " + month + " day: " + day + " date: " +
 date+ " year: " + year + " time: " + time;<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And then <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> our page and <strong>Show Time</strong>. And there you see that the <code>date</code>
 didn't work because I had to put the parentheses. So that's what 
happens if you don't put the opening and closing parenthesis, you'll get
 that "function getDate()", doesn't really makes sense. I'll go ahead 
and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, <strong>Show Time</strong>. And 
so there we got the proper date of the month. Okay, so you have to be 
aware of how the time feature works with JavaScript. And there is a 
little quirk such as the number of milliseconds since January 1st, 1970.
 But using this information, you can start to parse some really 
incredible things. And you're going to have to do little bit of math in 
order to figure things out. But it's a really useful feature and you 
should make a part of your toolkit when you're working with JavaScript 
and HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks 
the Show Time button. In addition to the information regarding the 
current day, date, time, and time zone, the following information is 
displayed:<br>Month: 4 day: 3 date: function getDate() { [native code] } year: 2014 time: 1399477398405<br>Since
 the code for date did not work, the presenter adds the opening and 
closing parentheses in the code. Therefore, the code now reads "date = 
now.getDate();". He then refreshes the web page and clicks the Show Time
 button. The date is now correctly displayed as "7".<br></em>

Creating a Countdown Timer in an HTML5 Document
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can create a countdown timer 
using JavaScript. Okay, so I've already set up a web page that has a 
little form field here. We can enter a date in this format and 
optionally we can enter a time as well. When we click <strong>GO</strong>, we're going to run a function and that function will be called <code>"doIt()"</code> and it'll show our "Countdown" time. I've already actually started the <code>function</code>. So let's go ahead and create our <code>Date()</code> object, so <code>now = new Date();</code> remember, make sure to use the opening and closing parentheses. Now what that'll do is set the present date and time and <code>then =</code> and this will be the time that we've entered up here, so <code>then = Date.parse</code>. What we want to do here is just get the <code>document.getElementById</code>, the <code>"date"</code> field where we entered the date, <code>.value</code>, okay. So we want to grab that information. And then we're going to create a variable called <code>daysLeft = then - now;</code>
 so it's actually a mathematical function that we create here saying 
take the date that we want to countdown to and subtract the current date
 from it and it'll actually work. JavaScript will do the math for us. So
 we need to now break it up and say, <code>days =</code>, <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag, a title tag, and a script tag. The script tag contains the doIT() 
function, which is empty. The body section contains the following code:<br>Enter a date in the format "December 24, 2014"&lt;br&gt;(optionally add time, e.g., "17:00:00")<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="text" id="date" size="50" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;button onclick="doIt()"&gt;GO&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;div
 style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 400px; 
height: 50px; border: 2px solid; line-height: 24pxfont-family: 
Arial;"&gt;<br>Countdown:&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;div id="Countdown"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>The
 web page shows the label "Enter a date in the format "December 24, 
2014"" followed by a line break and another label "(optionally add time,
 e.g., "17:00:00")". The labels are followed by a text field, the GO 
button, and the Countdown section. The presenter types the following 
code in the doIt() function:<br>now = new Date();<br>then = Date.parse(document.getElementById("date").value);<br>daysLeft = then - now;<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
and here is where we need to use <code>Math.floor</code> function 
because what we need to do is take the information the JavaScript, the 
browser, uses and put it into a meaningful format that we can read. And 
so in this case, it's <code>daysLeft /</code> and then this function, so a <code>(1000*60*60*24)</code>. Okay, we're talking about hours now and hours of course are <code>24</code> hours a day, okay. That's going to calculate the number of <code>days</code> for us. And we use <code>1000</code> because everything is in milliseconds. So we need to be able to set that up so that the math is done properly, <code>hours = Math.floor(daysLeft / (1000*60*60))</code>, remember <code>60</code> for minutes, seconds, and hours, <code>mins = Math.floor(daysLeft /</code> and now we're breaking it down even more, so <code>(1000*60)</code>. Okay, this will be our minutes. And then <code>secs = Math.floor(daysLeft / 1000);</code> and actually I don't even need to have the parentheses there, that will work. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the DoIt() function as follows:<br>days = Math.floor(daysLeft / (1000*60*60*24));<br>hours = Math.floor(daysLeft / (1000*60*60));<br>mins = Math.floor(daysLeft / (1000*60));<br>secs = Math.floor(daysLeft / 1000);<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Okay, so then I'm going to set up some variables for date, days, <code>dd = days;</code> <code>hh = hours - days * 24;</code> this is where we're actually doing the math to create the countdown between <code>now</code> and <code>then</code>. <code>mn = mins – hours * 60;</code> trust me this math will work, <code>ss = secs - mins * 60;</code> so you probably see what we're doing here is we're actually doing this subtraction, <code>hours</code>, <code>days</code>, <code>mins</code> to <code>hours</code>, <code>secs</code> to <code>mins</code> where we can finally do this <code>document.getElementById</code> and then we use our <code>"Countdown"</code> container, which is right here, capital <code>C</code> for <code>"Countdown"</code>. I need to make sure we use a capital <code>C</code>, <code>.innerHTML = dd + ' days ' + hh + ' hours ' + mm + ' minutes ' +</code> and then finally, we'll do <code>ss + ' seconds '</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the doIt() function as follows:<br>dd = days;<br>hh = hours - days * 24;<br>mm = mins - hours * 60;<br>ss = secs - mins * 60;<br>document.getElementById("Countdown").innerHTML = dd + ' days ' + hh + ' hours ' + mm + ' minutes ' + ss + ' seconds ';<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And once we've got that all set up, then we need to make our braces, 
make sure our braces are closed properly. We need a closing brace there 
and then a comma and then <code>1000</code>. The reason we use <code>1000</code>, so that looks good, the reason we use <code>1000</code> is because remember we're doing a <code>setInterval</code> up here. Actually that's the one thing that I forgot to do. Make sure that we use <code>setInterval</code>, <code>setInterval</code> will actually allow us to...it's one thing I forgot to do. Okay, so we're actually going to use <code>setInterval(function (countdown()</code>. Alright, and that looks pretty good. Okay, so <code>setInterval</code>
 is going to update the clock for us. It's actually going to show us a 
countdown rather than showing us a static date from the moment that we 
actually click the <strong>GO</strong> button. So down here is the timing for that interval and in this case, a <code>1000</code> milliseconds. And I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong>. And let's pick a date. Christmas sounds pretty good, go ahead and <strong>Copy</strong> that, <strong>Paste</strong> it in here. Actually make that <code>December 25, 2014</code> and <strong>GO</strong>, <br>
<em>The presenter adds a closing squiggly bracket and types the code 
",1000);". Then, above the code for creating a date object, he types the
 code "setInterval(function countdown() {". This encloses the entire 
code of the doIt() function within the setInterval function. The 
presenter saves the index.html file and refreshes the web page to view 
the output. He copies the date "December 24, 2014" from the label and 
pastes it in the text field. Then he changes "December 24" to "December 
25" in the text field. He clicks the Go button.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
and there is our "Countdown", okay. Now you can speed it up and just to sort of better understand <code>setInterval</code>, if I make that <code>100</code> milliseconds, <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong> and <strong>GO</strong>, okay, that "Countdown" is going to happen a little quicker, but it's not really necessary because the <code>1000</code> is seconds anyways, okay. So we don't actually need to do that, <code>1000</code> would be fine, <code>100</code> is not going to speed up the actual "Countdown" because we're still seeing the actual "seconds" that are being counted. <br>
<em>The Countdown section displays the following information "231 days 
12 hours 2 minutes 55 seconds". The value of seconds in the section is 
decreasing to show that the countdown has begun. To speed up the 
countdown, the presenter changes the value "1000" to "100" at the end of
 the code for the setInterval function. Then he saves the file, 
refreshes the web page, and views the changes in the speed of the 
countdown. Since there is no change as such in the speed of the 
countdown, so the presenter changes the value back to "1000" in the 
code.</em>

How to Use JavaScript Timers in an HTML5 Document
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll discuss how you can use JavaScript timers. Now, I'll start by creating a <code>script</code> here, <code>script type="text/javascript"</code>, let the browser know that we're running JavaScript. And what I want to do is create a variable, I'll call this <code>timeIt</code> and here is where we use <code>setInterval</code>, so it looks like this, a capital I and then in parenthesis a function that we're going to run called <code>updateMe</code> and then the time, okay, the time is in millisecond, so <code>5000</code> milliseconds is going to be every 5 seconds. Go ahead and put a semicolon in there and then create our function, so <code>function</code> is called <code>updateMe()</code> and it'll be a simple function. We're just going to, maybe, pop up an <code>alert</code> that says <code>("5 seconds have passed")</code>. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> our browser and wait about 5 seconds, "5 seconds have passed". Now if I click <strong>OK</strong>, every 5 seconds we'll get a message saying that 5 more seconds have passed. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the head section,
 the presenter adds the opening and closing script tags in separate 
lines of code. The opening script tag reads "&lt;script 
type="text/javascript"&gt;". Then he types the code "var timeIt = 
setInterval(updateMe, 5000);" to create the timeIt variable. He creates 
the updateMe() function by typing the following code:<br>function updateMe()<br>{<!-- --><br>alert("5 seconds have passed");<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. After 5 seconds, 
the "Message from web page" dialog box shows up. The dialog box contains
 the note "5 seconds have passed" and the OK button. The presenter 
clicks the OK button to close the dialog box. After every 5 seconds, the
 dialog box opens.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Pretty simple, it can get irritating very quickly though as you might 
well imagine. You want to be careful about setting this value too low, 
the lower you set them, the quicker the alerts are going to be popping 
up and you might get into a situation where you're actually getting more
 alerts than you can handle. But the interval is a really useful feature
 that allows you to set timing events for any function. So anything that
 we put inside this <code>function</code> called <code>updateMe()</code>,
 that we called here is going to run every 5 seconds. And once you start
 to take advantage of that, you can do some really fantastic things 
using HTML5, JavaScript, and the <code>setItnterval</code> feature. <br>
<em>The presenter points to the value "5000" in the code for the timeIt variable.</em>

Creating a Scrolling Marquee in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can create a scrolling marquee 
using JavaScript. Okay, so here I've created a page that's got a <code>div</code> container called <code>"marquee"</code>
 and you can see the styles there and it's just a black sort of bar 
across the top of the page and here is where I create the JavaScript. 
Now, what I want to do is create the JavaScript in the <code>body</code> section because we're referencing now the <code>id="marquee"</code> and this won't work if we put it in the <code>head</code> section, <code>type="text/javascript"</code>. And what we're going to do with this <code>script</code> is start by creating a variable, I'll call this 0 or <code>i</code>, <code>i=0;</code>
 and then create some text and this will be our marquee text. So 
something like this. Make it nice and long because that's marquees 
normally are. And you can put anything in here that you want and once 
I've created that, let's move to the next line. And we're going to 
create our sequence, so <code>var sequence</code> and I'll call whatever we want, but we want to call it <code>sequence</code> in this instance, it just sounds good, equal <code>setInterval</code>. So we're going to use that <code>setInterval</code> and create a function called <code>update</code> that'll run say every <code>100</code> milliseconds, so we want it nice and fast. Now, down here, I'll create the <code>function</code> called <code>update</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag, a title tag, and a style tag. The following code is enclosed within
 the opening and closing style tags:<br>{<!-- --><br>font-family: Calibri;<br>}<br>#marquee {<!-- --><br>width: 680px;<br>height: 20px;<br>border: 1px solid black;<br>padding-left: 15px;<br>}<br>The
 body section contains the code "&lt;div 
id="marquee"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;". The presenter adds the opening 
and closing script tags in separate lines of code in the body section. 
The opening script tag reads "&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;". To
 create a variable and to specify the marquee text, the presenter types 
the following code:<br> i = 0;<br>myText = "Welcome to our site! This week only – 25% off all storage devices! Check out our storage section."<br>Then, to create the sequence variable, he types the code "var sequence = setInterval(update, 100);". <br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And again remember, we're using a <code>function</code> here <code>update</code> that's going to run every <code>100</code> milliseconds. So <code>function update()</code> and what we want to do now is define the marquee text. So the reason I set the variable <code>i</code> here, we're starting it at <code>0</code> is now we're going to increment it every time we run this function using <code>setInterval</code>, which is every <code>100</code> milliseconds. So I'm going to add one to <code>i</code> and then I'm going to say, <code>if (i &lt; myText.length)</code>,
 because what we wanted to do is have it run for the entire duration of 
the length of this text. So this will work no matter how long or short 
you set the text. If it's actually rather than, less than I'll set that 
to greater than, if it's <code>i &gt; myText.length</code>, then what we want to do, <code>i &gt; myText.length</code>, what we want to do is we want to reset <code>i = 0;</code> we want to start at the beginning again. Once we've done that, now we can create our <code>marqueeText = myText.substring</code>, we're going to use <code>substring</code> here because what we want to do is say, begin at <code>i</code>, whatever <code>i</code> is <code>myText.length</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter creates the update function by typing the following code:<br>function update() {<!-- --><br>i++;<br>if (i &gt; myText.length)<br>{<!-- --><br>i = 0;<br>}<br>marqueeText= myText.substring(i, myText.length);<br>}<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So that's going to run from <code>i</code> to length of <code>myText</code>. Now, what that means is that <code>i</code> is going to start at <code>0</code>
 right there and then it's going to be one and it's going to start 
there, and it's going to start there. Every time we increment <code>i</code>,
 okay, it's going to start at the next letter and then store all the 
information from there to the end of the string, okay, that's why we've <code>myText.length</code>,
 okay. But what we want to do is we also want to account for this 
beginning text, because if we're starting say, over here, okay, we still
 have all this text to deal with, we want to take this text and swap it 
and put it here at the end. So we do that this way, <code>marqueeText +=</code> because we want to add to the <code>marqueeText</code>.
 Now, what I'm going to do here is put in a bunch of nonbreaking spaces,
 that's a character entity in HTML. If we put hard spaces just using a 
spacebar, this wouldn't work. I want to put some spaces in between the 
end of this and the beginning of this, okay, so I'm just going to <strong>Copy</strong> that and <strong>Paste</strong> it in several times, create some hard or some nonbreaking spaces for text. And then <code>marqueeText +=</code>, <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the update() function as follows:<br>marqueeText + = "&amp;nbsp;";<br>To
 provide a number of nonbreaking spaces at the beginning and at the end 
of the marquee text, he types "&amp;nbsp;" several times in the above 
code. <br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
and what we're going to do is, say, <code>myText.substring(0,i)</code>, okay, so what we're doing is we're now saying, okay, we want to start at the very beginning and count upto and only including <code>i</code> or up to <code>i</code>
 and show that at the end of this text and that will create that 
simulated marquee or it's not simulated, it's an actual marquee effect, 
but it'll create the effect that that text is scrolling over and over 
again. And then finally what I'll do is create our output, so <code>document.getElementById</code>, we're going to use that <code>("marquee")</code> output that we created right here, <code>.innerHTML</code>, so we're going to put it inside the container <code>= marqueeText</code>. So I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 the page and you can see there is our marquee text now. Now notice 
there are some spaces right here between the beginning and the end and 
that's great. That's what we wanted to use in the nonbreaking spaces, 
but that marquee feature works because of the <code>substring</code> and, sort of, counting from that <code>i</code> wherever that begins till the end of the text and then adding two at the end using this <code>substring</code> line at the beginning upto <code>i</code>. <br>
<em>To add an effect to the marquee text, he types the code "marqueeText
 += myText.substring(0, i);" in the update() function. Then to create 
the output, he types the code 
"document.getElementById("marquee").innerHTML = marqueeText;". He saves 
the index.html file and refreshes the web page to view the output. The 
web page shows the marquee text the presenter specified. The marquee 
text scrolls over and over again due to the effect applied on it, and 
there are a number of nonbreaking spaces at the beginning and at the end
 of the marquee text.</em>

Confirming User Input Using Confirm in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can confirm user input using JavaScript. Okay, so here I've got a <code>"button"</code> and a little prompt there to say <code>Press to Continue</code> and then here, we're going to use the <code>onclick</code> event and run a function called <code>"confirmMe()"</code>, which we haven't created yet. Let's go ahead and create that <code>function</code>. So a <code>script type="text/javascript"</code> and here is our function, <code>function confirmMe()</code> like that. Now, what I want to start with is a variable, I'll call it <code>result</code>, an empty variable and then a variable called <code>check</code> and this will be our confirmation. So we use <code>confirm</code> and then inside the parenthesis, whatever the confirmation text is going to be, <code>("Would you like to proceed?")</code>. Now, I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and we just test it. Okay, there we have our confirmation dialog, we have our <strong>OK</strong> and our <strong>Cancel</strong>, but unfortunately clicking it right now doesn't really have any effect. So <strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong>, it'll close the dialog, but we actually want to be able to test what the user chose. So here is where we do that, <code>if (check == true)</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag. The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;p&gt;Press to Continue&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;input type="button" onclick="confirmMe()" value="Submit" /&gt;<br>&lt;p id="output"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>The
 web page shows the label "Press to Continue" followed and the Submit 
button. In the head section, the presenter adds the opening and closing 
script tags in separate lines of code. The opening script tag reads 
"&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;". To create the confirmMe() 
function, he types the following code:<br>function confirmMe()<br>{<!-- --><br>var result;<br>var check = confirm("Would you like to proceed?")<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output.
 He clicks the Submit button and a dialog box with the note "Would you 
like to proceed?" opens. He clicks the OK button to close the dialog 
box.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now, remember we created that confirmation right there inside the variable <code>check</code>. So we'll get a true or false, if <code>true</code>, then okay, so if <strong>OK</strong> has been pressed, then we get a <code>true</code> and we'll just put in here <code>result = "Proceeding";</code> otherwise, okay, so it's not true, it's a false, <code>result = "Cancelling"</code>. Now, once we've done that, let's go ahead and just output the information to the screen by using <code>document.getElementById("output")</code>, because I've created a paragraph tag here with the <code>id</code> output, so we can store information there, <code>.innerHTML = result</code>. If I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong> our page, when I click <strong>Submit</strong>, okay and I choose <strong>OK</strong>, we can see we get the message "Proceeding", but if I click it and press <strong>Cancel</strong>, okay, now the browser knows that we chose <strong>Cancel</strong> and so that's how you use a confirmation dialog and it can be very useful in setting up your web pages in HTML5. <br>
<em>To add functionality to the OK and Cancel buttons of the dialog box,
 the presenter types the following code in the confirmMe() function:<br>if (check == true)<br>{ result = "Proceeding";}<br>else<br>{result = "Cancelling";}<br>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = result;<br>The
 presenter saves the index.html file and refreshes the web page to view 
the output. He clicks the Submit button and the dialog box opens. He 
clicks the OK button, which closes the dialog box and displays the 
message "Proceeding" below the Submit button. The presenter again clicks
 the Submit button to open the dialog box and then clicks the Cancel 
button. This closes the dialog box and displays the message "Cancelling"
 below the Submit button.<br></em>

Capturing User Input from a Prompt in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll discuss how you can capture user input using a JavaScript prompt. Okay, so here I've a set up a <code>"button"</code>, when the button is clicked, we're going to run a function called <code>"nameMe()"</code>, so let's go ahead and create that <code>function</code>. I'll start with the <code>script</code> tag and then <code>type</code> and make sure that the browser knows that we're running JavaScript and then start our <code>function nameMe()</code>. Now, the way this works is I'm going to create a variable, I'll call it <code>result</code> and we actually put the <code>prompt</code> command right in the variable <code>("Enter your name to continue")</code>. Now, if I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and press <strong>Submit</strong>,
 okay, there is our prompt and we got a little text there in place where
 we can type our information, but the only problem is that clicking is 
not really going to do anything, because we need to pull that 
information. So I'm going to use this <code>"output"</code> container that I created down here, it's just a paragraph tag with an <code>id</code> of <code>"output"</code>. So I'll use <code>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML</code> because we're actually going to be storing information in there and it'll be <code>result</code>. So it'll be whatever resulted from the user pressing <strong>OK</strong> after they have typed information in the <code>prompt</code>. So I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, and then click <strong>Submit</strong> and now I can type in and we get information back to us and we can even friendly it up a bit by doing something like this <code>"Welcome to our website, " + result +"!"</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag. The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;p&gt;Press to Continue&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;input type="button" onclick="nameMe()" value="Submit" /&gt;<br>&lt;p id="output"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>The
 web page shows the label "Press to Continue" and the Submit button. In 
the head section, the presenter adds the opening and closing script tags
 in separate lines of code. The opening script tag reads "&lt;script 
type="text/javascript"&gt;". To create the nameMe() function, he types 
the following code:<br>function nameMe()<br>{<!-- --><br>var result = prompt("Enter your name to continue") ;<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page to view the output 
of the code. He clicks the Submit button and the "localhost needs some 
information" dialog box opens. The dialog box contains the "Enter your 
name to continue" label, a text field, and the OK and Cancel buttons. 
The text field is set to "undefined" by default. The presenter clicks 
the OK button to close the dialog box. To add functionality to the OK 
and Cancel buttons, the presenter types the following code in the 
nameMe() function:<br>Document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = result;<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page to see the output. He clicks 
the Submit button and the "localhost needs some information" dialog box 
opens. He types "Jamie Campbell" in the text field and clicks the OK 
button. This closes the dialog box and displays the name "Jamie 
Campbell" below the Submit button. To change the text displayed after 
clicking the OK button, the presenter modifies the code as follows:<br>Document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Welcome to our web site, " + result +"!";<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and now type my name, press <strong>OK</strong>, and there you go. And that's how you use the prompt in HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks

Using Drag and Drop in HTML5
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
I've actually prewritten the code to explain drag and drop. There's 
quite a bit of it and I wanted to make sure it was understandable. To 
start, I created a <code>div</code> that would be our target; that was where the user will drop the actual object. So on the div I <code>id</code>'d it as <code>target</code> and I associated with the target an <code>ondrop</code> event, which calls a <code>drop</code> function and passes the <code>event</code>, and an <code>ondragover event</code>, which calls <code>allowDrop</code> and passes it the event. On the image, which we sourced as <code>kitten.jpg</code>, we put a <code>width</code> of <code>300</code>, a <code>height</code> of <code>200</code>, and most importantly, we set the <code>draggable</code> attribute to <code>true</code>. <code>ondragstart</code> we called the <code>drag</code>
 function from above. So we have our three callback functions here in 
the script that I'll go over in a minute. On the target, I set a <code>width</code> of <code>350</code>, a <code>height</code> of <code>250</code>, and a <code>1px solid black</code> border around the actual target. Put a little space in the bottom margin of <code>20px</code> to separate the target from the object. We'll just <strong>Preview</strong> it real quick here in the actual IDE. There's our target and there's our object that will drop. <br>
<em>The listeners.html file is open in the Komodo Edit window. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a title 
tag, a style tag, and a script tag. The following code is enclosed 
within the opening and closing style tags:<br>#target<br>{<!-- --><br>width: 350px<br>height: 250px;<br>border: 1px solid black;<br>margin-bottom: 20px;<br>}<br>The following code is enclosed within the opening and closing script tags:<br>function allowDrop(ev)<br>{<!-- --><br>ev.preventDefault();<br>}<br>function drag(ev)<br>{<!-- --><br>ev.dataTransfer.setData("Text", ev.target.id);<br>}<br>function drop(ev)<br>{<!-- --><br>ev.preventDefault();<br>var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("Text");<br>ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));<br>}<br>The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;div id="target" ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;img id="dragMe" src="kitten.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)"&gt;<br>The presenter previews the file in a test browser and an empty section and the image of a kitten are shown.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So following the life cycle of this, the user will start to drag the image and the <code>ondragstart</code> event fires calling <code>drag</code> and passing it the <code>event</code>. So the drag function will fire first. And on the event's <code>dataTransfer</code> object, it's going to set the data to this key value pair: <code>Text</code> and <code>ev.target.id</code>. So what that means is the target is going to be the image and the id is going to be <code>dragMe</code>. So we're essentially, when we start dragging, on the event, setting the <code>dataTransfer</code> object, its key value paired to <code>Text</code> and <code>dragMe</code>.
 So the user's dragging the actual object and then when they go over the
 target and release, we have a couple of other callback function. When 
we drag it over, we call <code>allowDrop</code> and pass it the event. And all <code>allowDrop</code>
 does is prevent the default behavior of the event in the browser. But 
then when we drop, when the user actually releases the mouse button, we 
run <code>preventDefault</code> again on the event and then we get from the event the <code>dataTransfer</code> object, which is going to be <code>getData</code> and <code>Text</code> – remember, <code>Text</code> is the name of the key value pair. So data will now include the id <code>"dragMe"</code>, and then we'll use this when we say <code>ev.target.appendChild(document ElementById</code>, and this will be <code>dragMe</code>.
 So we'll essentially append to this div this image object, and in the 
end, the image will end up inside the div instead of outside of it. So 
let's demo this in an actual browser. Go ahead and bring up Firefox 
here, <br>
<em>The presenter previews the file in Mozilla Firefox.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
and I drag, I release, and now the image is inside the actual target. 
Let me do this again, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull up 
here our Firefox console from Firebug and we're going to take a look at 
how the information is stored inside the dom of the browser. And notice 
here at this point, before we've done anything, the <code>div</code> 
element ends and then the image element begins. Now I'm going to drag 
the kitty into the target, make a little more space here, and now you'll
 notice that the image is inside the div. Right, the <code>div</code> 
starts here, ends here, and the image is inside it. So the way that 
happened is this line right here. We appended the child, so essentially 
making the image a child of the div or the logical division. This is a 
very common pattern that you see underneath all drag-and-drop 
interactions in HTML5. <br>
<em>The web page shows an empty section and the image of a kitten. The 
presenter drags the image and drops it inside the empty section. This 
places the image inside the section. The presenter refreshes the web 
page and opens the Mozilla Firefox console. This divides the browser 
into two parts, design view and console view. In the console view, the 
presenter points to the code in the body section. Then, in the design 
view, he drags the image and drops it inside the empty section. This 
moves the code of the image to the div tag in the console view.</em>

Accessing Form Data
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
HTML forms are an important part of web design. And once you put all 
that work into designing a form and make it look great, how can you 
access the information that users type into those forms? Well, it's 
pretty easy using JavaScript. So in this video, I'll explain how you can
 access form data once it's been entered. I've created a simple HTML <code>form</code> and inside that <code>form</code>, we have got four inputs: <code>Name:</code>, <code>Address:</code>, <code>Email:</code>, and <code>Phone:</code> number. And then when we click the <code>"button"</code>, we're actually going to run a function called <code>"doIt()"</code>. So let's go ahead and create that function. Make sure we use <code>type="text/javascript"</code> so the browser knows what we're running here, and then create our <code>function doIt()</code>. Now in order to get the information from the form, what we do is we create a variable, I'll call it <code>elem</code> for elements, <code>document.forms</code>,
 and we put in square brackets afterwards a value. And so you could have
 multiple forms on a page, so this way we will pick the very first form 
by using <code>[0]</code>. So if I go <code>alert(elem);</code> right now just create an alert, so we see what is contained in that variable. And then type <strong>GO</strong>
 we see we have "[object HTMLFormElement]", so that's great. We know 
that it's a form element so we can actually do this, let's say <code>elem[0].value</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains the head section and the body section. The head section 
contains a meta tag and a title tag. The body section contains the 
following code:<br>&lt;form name="form1"&gt;<br>Name: &lt;input type="text" id="name" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Address: &lt;input type="text" id="name" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Email: &lt;input type="text" id="name" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Phone: &lt;input type="text" id="name" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="button" onclick="doIt()" value="GO" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>&lt;span id="output"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>The
 web page shows four text fields – Name, Address, Email, and Phone – and
 the GO button. In the head section, the presenter adds the opening and 
closing script tags in separate lines of code. The opening script tag 
reads "&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;". He creates the doIt() 
function by typing the following code:<br>function doIt()<br>{<!-- --><br>var elem = document.forms[0];<br>alert(elem);<br>}<br>The
 presenter refreshes the web page. Leaving the four text fields blank, 
he clicks the GO button. This opens the "Message from web page" dialog 
box, which shows the note "[object HTMLFormElement]" and the OK button. 
The presenter clicks the OK button to close the dialog box. In the 
doIt() function, he changes the code "alert(elem);" to 
"alert(elem[0].value);".<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and then type in my name in this form field, and click <strong>GO</strong>. And then you can see that we have captured that value using the <code>.value</code> feature. So suddenly we can actually pull out the information using a simple <code>for</code> loop. So it looks like this <code>var i=0; i &lt; elem.length</code> because we actually want to go the entire length of the element, <code>-1</code>. Okay, we want to stop at the end and then <code>i++</code> to increment the loop. Now inside the loop, we will create a variable called <code>formData = new Array;</code> we will create an array here. And then <code>formData[i]</code>, okay, we're going to count through using <code>[i]</code> in a loop equals <code>elem[i].value</code> again we're going to use that <code>.value +</code> and we will add in a line break here, so we can break everything up. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the index.html file and refreshes the web page. 
He types "Jamie" in the Name text field and clicks the GO button. This 
opens the "Message from web page" dialog box, which shows the name 
"Jamie" and the OK button. Next the presenter types the following code 
in the doIt() function:<br>for (var i=0; I &lt; elem.length - 1; i++)<br>{<!-- --><br>var formData = new Array;<br>formData[i] = elem[i].value + "&lt;br&gt;";<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And then finally, what we will do is we will actually write that information so <code>document.getElementById</code>, I've created a container on the page called <code>("output")</code> so right here it's a <code>span</code> container, <code>.innerHTML = formData[i]</code>.
 Okay, so what we're doing is we're running through the entire length of
 each entry that was filed. So in the case of Jamie, that would be 5 
characters and it would write that information into the array and then 
put it on the page. So let's go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong>, and enter some real information. Now if I click <strong>GO</strong>, we see something happened there. And I know what it was, I forgot to put a <code>+=</code> here, we want to keep adding that information. So let's go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong>, do that again. That's fine, we don't actually have to type in the actual information, we're not validating it, and then click <strong>GO</strong>.
 And you can see that information has been captured using this 
relatively simple method. So it all comes down to using the 
document.forms grabbing the appropriate form number, in this case, it's 
the only form in the page so it'll be form <code>[0]</code> and then reading that information using element, the actual index location in brackets and then <code>.value</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the doIt() function as follows:<br>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = formData[i];<br>}<br>He
 saves the index.html file and refreshes the web page. He populates the 
four text fields with "Jamie", "123 State St.", "noone@nobody.com", and 
"555-555-5555", respectively. He clicks the GO button and the value in 
the Phone text field, which is "555-555-5555", is shown below the GO 
button. The presenter modifies a part of the code in the doIt() function
 as follows:<br>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += formData[i];<br>He
 again saves the file and refreshes the web page. He populates the four 
text fields with the same information and clicks the GO button. This 
displays the information populated in the four text fields below the GO 
button.<br></em>

Validating Form Data
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can validate form data using 
JavaScript. Now for this example, I've just created a simple form and 
we're asking the user to enter a number. We can use this method to check
 for text as well, but we're going to do numbers for this one. When we 
click the button, we're going to run a function called <code>"chkInput()"</code>. So let's go ahead and create that, <code>function chkInput()</code>. Now the first thing I'm going to do is create a variable called <code>x</code>.
 I'm not going put anything in it because we want to use this as a true 
or false value. So I'm just going to establish the variable and then we 
will refer to it in a minute. And I'm going to create a variable called <code>numInp = document.getElementById</code>. In this case, we want to grab the contents of this form field right here and it's called <code>"num1"</code>, so I'll just go ahead and put that there <code>("num1")</code>. And what we want to do here is use <code>.value</code>
 because we want to grab the information that the user has typed into 
that field. So...actually I don't even need to do that, I'll just put a 
semicolon and we're storing that information in a variable called <code>numInp</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains the head section and the body section. The head section 
contains a meta tag and a title tag. The body section contains the 
following code:<br>Please enter a number:&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;form name="myForm" action="#" onsubmit="return false"&gt;<br>&lt;input type="text" id="num1" name="num1" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit now" onclick="chkInput()" /&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;span id="output"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>The
 web page shows the label "Please enter a number:", a text field, and 
the Submit now button. In the head section, the presenter adds the 
opening and closing script tags in separate lines of code. The opening 
script tag reads "&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;". He creates the
 chkInput() function by typing the following code:<br>function chkInput()<br>{<!-- --><br>var x;<br>var numInp = document.getElementById("num1").value;<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now I'm going to create another variable called <code>validNums</code>...and we can put a variable. I should put it there, put <code>var</code> in there just to make sure that we establish the variable. We're going to create a variable called <code>var validNums =</code>
 and here I'll use what's called a regular expression. Regular 
expressions are expressions that you create that you can use to, sort 
of, create wildcards and sets of information you want to compare in 
JavaScript and it looks like this, <code>/[]/</code>. And inside the brackets, we will put <code>0-9</code>.
 And that'll have the browser check for actual numerical input. And then
 I'm also going to put a period and the reason I want to do that is 
because I want somebody to be able to enter a decimal value just as 
easily. So we're going to check and make sure that a decimal is a valid 
character to enter in that field. Now once I've done that, I'll just set
 up an <code>if</code> statement here, <code>if (numInp.match(validNums))</code>...we're using another method here in JavaScript to match the <code>validNums</code>...so in parentheses <code>(validNums)</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the chkInput() function as follows:<br>var validNums = /[0-9. ]/;<br>if (numInp.match(validNums))<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So all we're doing is saying here if the information that's been typed 
in here has a match right there to this variable...and this variable 
once again is a set of numbers and the decimal...so if there is a match,
 then we're going to say <code>x=true</code>. So now we're going to use that <code>x</code> variable that we created. Now once I've done that, then we can go ahead and say this. I'll create <code>document.getElementById</code> because we want to <code>("output")</code> some information on the screen, let the user know that he/she did a good job. So we have got an <code>"output" span</code> right here that we will use, <code>.innerHTML = "Thank you!"</code> Now we will <code>return</code> from here. So in other words, we will just <code>return</code> and that'll end the function. And we're going to <code>return x</code>. What that means is that we can break out of this function, but we can return the value of <code>x</code>. So we also know that that value <code>true</code> is being returned in case we need to do something with it. We're not going to, but <code>return x</code> will just allow us to pass that information back once the function is finished. Now what I'll do here is create an <code>else</code> statement. So if it doesn't match a number or the decimal, then we're going to say <code>alert("Please enter numbers only!")</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the chkInput() function as follows:<br>{<!-- --><br>x=true;<br>document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Thank You!";<br>return x;<br>}<br>else<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And then I'm going to also set <code>x</code> to <code>false</code>. So I'll put that there <code>x = false</code>, <code>("Please enter numbers only!");</code> and then <code>return x;</code>
 and that'll return a false value back to JavaScript and then we can use
 it if we need to. Again we're not going to, but we could if we wanted 
to. So I'll <strong>Save</strong> that, let's go ahead and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page. And I'll start by typing in nothing. So if we type nothing and press <strong>Submit</strong> <strong>now</strong>,
 we're going to get that message, of course, because we haven't entered 
any numbers. Now if I type in some text, again we're going to see 
"Please enter numbers only!". If I type in a number, we get a message 
saying "Thank You!". So we validated that, that's an actual valid entry.
 And if we use that decimal as well to create a decimal value and <strong>Submit now</strong>,
 we still get "Thank You!", so that works as well. So effectively what 
we're doing here is grabbing the information from this form field and 
using a regular expression to check for numbers. And once again, you 
could just as easily do this with characters like this. And this you 
would have to actually use the lowercase and uppercase, check for 
character input. But you can use regular expressions to check that 
information and validate it using JavaScript. <br>
<em>The presenter continues to type code in the chkInput() function as follows:<br>{<!-- --><br>x=false;<br>alert("Please enters numbers only!");<br>return x;<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He leaves the text
 field blank and clicks the Submit now button. This opens the "Message 
from web page" dialog box, which contains the note "Please enter numbers
 only!" and the OK button. He clicks the OK button to close the dialog 
box and types "jamie" in the text field. He clicks the Submit now button
 and the dialog box opens with the same note. Now the presenter types 
"1234" in the text field and clicks the Submit now button. This displays
 the message "Thank you!" below the button. Next the presenter types 
"1234.256526" in the text field and clicks the Submit now button. This 
too displays the message "Thank you!" below the button. In the code, he 
changes the value of the validNums variable in the chkInput() function 
to "/[a-zA-Z]/;".<br></em>

Adding HTML Elements to a Web Page
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can add HTML elements to a web page using JavaScript. Okay, so I've got a <code>"button"</code> on this page that runs a function called <code>"doIt()"</code>
 that when we click it. Let's go ahead and create that function. Now 
what I'm going to do is start by creating a variable and I'll call this <code>newDiv</code>, so <code>newDiv = document.createElement</code>. And this is how we create new elements on the page. We're going to create a <code>div</code> element so we put <code>("div")</code>
 in here. And when we do that, we're actually not adding the object to 
the page just yet, we're actually creating it for the browser to place, 
but we actually need to do some things with it first. So once we have 
done that, we can say newDiv.innerHTML. We're going to change the actual
 contents or add contents to it rather, <code>"This is a DIV"</code>. And we can even do this, <code>div.className</code> with a capital N equals <code>"class1"</code> because down here, I've got a class already in my stylesheet called <code>class1</code>, so I'm going to apply that class to this <code>newDiv</code>. Now it's still not going to appear on the page yet. If I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and click nothing happens here. We have to add a final line here. And actually I did that wrong, that should be <code>newDiv.className</code>, remember, that's the object that we created. And then <code>document.body.appendChild</code>, so use <code>appendChild</code>. This is the command that'll actually add that <code>div</code> container that we created to the page. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains the head section and the body section. The head section 
contains a meta tag, a title tag, a script tag, and a style tag. The 
opening script tag reads "&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;." The 
following code is enclosed within the opening and closing style tags:<br>.class1<br>{<!-- --><br>font-family: 'Times New Roman';<br>font-size: 12px;<br>font-color: 'black';<br>width: 200px;<br>height: 75px;<br>background-color: #ff6a00;<br>}<br>The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;input type="button" onclick="doIt()" value="GO" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>The web page shows the GO button. The presenter creates the doIt() function in the script tag by typing the following code:<br>function doIt()<br>{<!-- --><br>var newDiv = document.createElement("div");<br>newDiv.innerHTML = "This is a DIV";<br>newDiv.className = "class1";<br> document.body.appendChild (newDiv);<br>}<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So if I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and then click <strong>GO</strong> there is our <code>div</code>
 container. So we have actually taken it, created it, added some 
information to it such as contents and a style and then put it on the 
page. But you can do that with other elements as well. So for instance, I
 can do this <code>var btn</code> for button equals <code>document.createElement</code>. And then again whatever you want to create you put in there, <code>("button")</code> and then <code>btn.innerHTML = "New button";</code>...actually no, maybe, I'll change that to click me, that's...buttons are supposed to be clicked so <code>"Click Me"</code> and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>. Now when I click <strong>GO</strong>,
 you're not going to see that button yet, because once again I actually 
have to add that button to the page. Now before I do that, I'm going to 
do this <code>document.body.appendChild</code> and in parentheses, I'm going to put <code>document.createElement</code>. I'm actually going to add an extra element here, it's a line break <code>('br')</code>, like that. And now I can do document and I just want to put a line break in-between that <code>div</code> container and the new button that we're creating so <code>appendChild</code> and, remember, we call it <code>(btn)</code> so there it is right there. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>.
 And that's how you create elements on an HTML page. And just use that 
particular tag name or element name and then use this method with the <code>appendChild</code> and you'll be able to create elements on the fly with JavaScript. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks 
the Go button and an orange-colored container with the text "This is 
DIV" appears. Next he adds the following code to the doIt() function:<br>var btn = document.createElement("button");<br>btn.innerHTML = "Click Me";<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks the GO button, but
 nothing new happens. The orange-colored container with the text "This 
is DIV" appears as before. To show the Click Me button in a separate 
line in the web page, the presenter adds the following code to the 
doIt() function:<br>document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));<br>document.body.appendChild(btn);<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks the GO button and 
the Click Me button appears below the orange-colored container.<br></em>

Modifying Form Elements
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can modify form elements using JavaScript. So here, I've created a <code>form</code> and it's got a number of elements: <code>Name</code>, <code>Address</code>, <code>Email</code>, <code>Phone</code>. They are all text type inputs and a <code>"button"</code> that'll run a function called <code>"doIt()"</code>, when we click the button. So let's go ahead and create that function. Make sure you put in the <code>type</code> so the browser knows what we're doing here. And then <code>function doIt()</code>. Now, what I want to do is grab the form element and it looks like this, it looks like <code>document.forms</code>.
 Now we put in parenthesis or square brackets, rather afterward a value 
and it reflects a value of the form on the page, in this case there is 
only one form and so that'll be <code>forms[0]</code>, but if add more 
than one form, we would just address them that way depending on how they
 were placed in the HTML. So we placed another form below this one, it 
would actually be forms[1] and then another one below that would be 
forms[2], and so on. What we want to do here is actually create a 
variable, so we have a variable called <code>elem</code> for element equals <code>document.forms[0]</code>. Now, what we can do at this point is see what is contained in that element object, so I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>.
 I don't even have to bother entering any information, I just want to 
see what's in there and what we have got is "[object HTMLFormElement]", 
that tells me that there is something in there that we can address by 
using this type of, actually let me get that back here. Let's take a 
look at <code>(elem[4])</code>, <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains the head section and the body section. The head section 
contains a meta tag and a title tag. The body section contains the 
following code:<br>&lt;form name="form1"&gt;<br>Name: &lt;input type="text" id="name" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Address: &lt;input type="text" id="add" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Email: &lt;input type="text" id="email" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Phone: &lt;input type="text" id="tel" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="button" onclick="doIt()" value="GO" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>&lt;span id="output"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>The
 web page shows four text fields – Name, Address, Email, and Phone – and
 the GO button. In the head section, the presenter adds the opening and 
closing script tags in separate lines of code. The opening script tag 
reads "&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;". He creates the doIt() 
function by typing the following code:<br>function doIt()<br>{<!-- --><br>var elem = document.forms[0];<br>alert(elem);<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. Leaving the four 
text fields blank, he clicks the GO button. This opens the "Message from
 web page" dialog box, which shows the note "[object HTMLFormElement]" 
and the OK button. The presenter clicks the OK button to close the 
dialog box. In the doIt() function, he changes the code "alert(elem);" 
to "alert(elem[4]);".<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
<strong>Refresh</strong> and click <strong>GO</strong>, okay, that's an 
input element and in this case actually 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, that's 
actually the button, okay. Let's see if we can get the <code>type</code> out of that, I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, yeah, so it's a "button", okay, and if I actually did <code>elem[3]</code>, <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong>,
 it's "text", okay, because we know that these four containers are text.
 So that's how you address it and if you can address it then you can 
start to change it, so for instance, let's do this, let's go <code>elem[3].value = "555-555-5555"</code>, so a phone number. <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, and if I click <strong>GO</strong>, we're actually forcing that information into that form field. Let's try something different here, <code>elem[4].value</code> and this is the button remember, so we're changing the button now equals <code>"Submit"</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and now when I click <strong>GO</strong>, the button has changed to <strong>Submit</strong>,
 so we can actually change the label on a button, not just the contents 
of a field. As a matter of fact, we could even do something else, let's 
do this <code>elem[4].type</code>, now remember, when we looked at <code>type</code>, the <code>type</code> was <code>"button"</code>, but let's change it to <code>"text"</code>, so I'll go ahead and put a semicolon there and then enter a <code>value</code> of <code>"Submit"</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong> the page and when I click <strong>GO</strong>,
 you can see that we actually changed it to a text field. So you can 
actually change the form elements, not just the contents of that form 
elements, but the type of form element using that relatively simple 
method. <br>
<em>The presenter refreshes the web page. Leaving the four text fields 
blank, he clicks the GO button. This opens the "Message from web page" 
dialog box, which now shows the note "[object HTMLInputElement]". The 
presenter clicks the OK button to close the dialog box. In the doIt() 
function, he changes the code "alert(elem[4]);" to 
"alert(elem[4].type);". He saves the file and refreshes the web page. 
Again, leaving the four text fields blank, he clicks the GO button. This
 opens the "Message from web page" dialog box, which now shows the text 
"button", indicating the type of the fifth element in the code. Next, to
 view the type of the fourth element in the code, he changes 
"alert(elem[4].type);" to "alert(elem[3].type);". He saves the file and 
refreshes the web page. He opens the "Message from web page" dialog box,
 which now shows the text "text", indicating the type of the fourth 
element in the code. Next he deletes the code "alert(elem[3].type);" and
 types "elem[3].value = "555-555-5555";". He saves the file and 
refreshes the web page. He clicks the GO button and the Phone text field
 is autopopulated with "555-555-5555". In a similar way, he specifies 
the value of the GO button by typing the code "elem[4].value = 
"Submit";" in the doIt() function. He saves the file and refreshes the 
web page. He clicks the GO button. As a result, the Phone text field is 
autopopulated with "555-555-5555" and the name of the GO button changes 
to Submit. Next the presenter types the code "elem[4].type = "text";" in
 the doIt() function to change the type of the fifth element, which is 
the GO button. He saves the file and refreshes the web page. He clicks 
the GO button. As a result, the Phone text field is autopopulated with 
"555-555-5555" and the Go button changes to a text field, which is 
autopopulated with "Submit".</em>

Modifying HTML5 Form Inputs Using CSS3
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Web page designer requires the use of forms. Whether it's a simple login
 form or a complex membership signup, forms represent an important part 
of web site creation, but default form fields have been around since the
 beginning of the Web and they are not very interesting on their own. So
 in this video, I'll explain how to modify form inputs using CSS3. Okay,
 so let's go ahead and create some inputs here. I'll just create an <code>input type="text"</code> and we will give this an <code>id</code> of <code>"username"</code>, put in a line break here. And then <code>input</code> and again we will create...actually this one we will make a <code>"password" id="pw"</code>, like that and then a line break. I'll go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>
 our page. And you can see there are our two inputs. There's not really 
much to them. As a matter of fact, maybe I'll just put some text in 
here, just so it looks more like a form, <strong>Save</strong> that, <strong>Refresh</strong>, and there you go. Now what we want to do here is create a stylesheet in the <code>head</code> section of our document and see how we can affect <code>input</code>. So I'm going to start with a <code>style</code> called <code>input</code> because that's what we're doing. We're changing the <code>input</code> tag, so <code>input</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter types the following code to create two text fields:<br>&lt;input type="text" id="username" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="password" id="pw" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page. This shows two text fields 
in the web page. To provide a label to the two text fields, the 
presenter types "Username" and "Password", respectively, before the code
 for each text field. He saves the file and refreshes the web page. This
 shows the Username and Password text fields in the web page. Next, in 
the head section, the presenter adds the opening and closing style tags 
in separate lines of code.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And let's go ahead and choose a <code>width</code> here, <code>180px</code>, <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and you can see that we can change the size of that <code>input</code>. Now generally the old fashioned way was to actually change the <code>style</code> or the <code>size</code> of the input here in the <code>html</code>
 tag, but you can actually do that in CSS and it's probably a better 
idea. There you go, we can actually increase the size of that. We can do
 some other things too. So for instance, we can change the font style. 
So let me just go ahead and type something in there, and we see it's 
just plain Arial. Let's change the <code>font-family</code> to <code>Calibri</code> and go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>. And you see it's a slightly different font there, so we have actually changed the font of that <code>input</code> field. So now what I'm going to do is just put an extra line here. And now what I'm going to do is use the pound symbol or <code>#</code> and let's choose the id <code>username</code> and pick a <code>color</code>, something like this, a dark orange. <br>
<em>To change the width of the two text fields, the presenter types the following code:<br>input<br>{<!-- --><br>width: 180px;<br>}<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page. The width of the two text 
fields have changed. To change the font of the text being entered in the
 two text fields, the presenter types the code "font-family: Calibri" in
 the input container. He saves the file and refreshes the web page. He 
types some dummy text in the Username text field to check the font, 
which is Calibri. After the closing squiggly bracket of the input 
container, the presenter types the following code to change the font 
color of the Username text field:<br>#username<br>{<!-- --><br>color: #ff6a00;<br>}<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, 
and you see now when I type, we're actually getting a different color in
 that field. So what we've done there is reference the actual <code>id</code> called <code>"username"</code> and just change this specific <code>input</code> rather than all the inputs the way we did up here. Now it may have occurred to you that we can also do this. We can change the <code>background-color</code>
 as well. So I could make this bright red and maybe just a sort of make 
this a little easier to read, put, well, a gold might work. I'll go 
ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and 
you can see there is our red form field now with a text inside it. So 
you can really do a lot with CSS with any type of input, form input, 
using one of these methods, either just referencing the <code>input</code> tag in general or referencing the actual <code>id</code> of that tag. We can do some really neat things, very quickly and easily with CSS3 and HTML5. <br>
<em>The presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. He types 
some dummy text in the Username text field; the font color of the dummy 
text is orange. To add a background color to the Username text field, he
 types the code "background-color: #f00;". Then he changes the font 
color of the Username text field to "#ffd800" so that it is readable 
with respect to the background color. He saves the file and refreshes 
the web page. The background color of the Username text field is shown 
as red. The presenter types some dummy text in the text field; the font 
color of the dummy text is yellow.</em>

Styling HTML5 Submit Buttons Using CSS3
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Web forms are an integral part of web design, but the default form 
fields have been around since the beginning of the Web and they are not 
very interesting on their own. Fortunately, you can modify form fields 
using CSS. And in this video, I'll explain how to style submit buttons 
using CSS3. Okay, so I'll start by creating a button, we use <code>input type="submit"</code> because we want a submit button. The <code>value</code> will be whatever is on the actual button itself. And then we will give it an <code>id="go"</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and that's pretty much what you would expect from a standard button in HTML. Now the thing is I'll go to the <code>head</code> section and after the <code>title</code>, create a <code>style</code> sheet. And here what we're going to do is we're going to do <code>input</code>, create a <code>style</code> for <code>input</code>. And let's go ahead and change the font, change the <code>font-family</code> to <code>Calibri</code> and the <code>font-size</code>, make it something really big like <code>26pt</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>. And you can see that you can change the <code>input</code> now. By using the <code>input</code> style, we're going to affect any <code>input</code>
 tag that's used on the page. So if we had text boxes, if we had 
password fields, whatever, they are all going to be affected by using 
this method. So we want to be careful about using this to style things 
like buttons. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag and a title tag, and the body section is empty. In the body section,
 the presenter types the following code to create the "Go do it!" 
button:<br>&lt;input type="submit" value="Go do it!" id="go" /&gt;<br>He
 saves the file and refreshes the web page. The "Go do it!" is shown in 
the web page. Next, in the head section, the presenter adds the opening 
and closing style tags in separate lines of code. To change the font and
 font size of the "Go do it!" button, he types the following code:<br>input<br> {<!-- --><br>font-family: Calibri;<br>font-size: 26pt;<br>}<br>The
 presenter saves the file and refreshes the web page. The font and font 
size of the "Go do it!" button have changed to Calibri and 26pt, 
respectively.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Another way to do this would be to access the button's <code>id</code>. Remember we gave it this <code>id</code>, so I'll just use the <code>#</code> or pound symbol and then <code>go</code> and now what we can do is start to change things with <code>color</code>. Let's go ahead and create, say, a blue. <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> and you can see that that changed the actual button text to blue. But let's go ahead and change the <code>background-color</code> as well, <code>background-color</code>. And we will change the <code>background</code>, say, to an orange, go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>.
 And you can change the color of that button as well. So you can do all 
sorts of things very quickly and easily using CSS styles with buttons 
and IDs. And I'll try something a little softer there because that was 
awfully dark. I'm going to <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>, and that's not too bad. Now you can also do things like change the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of a button. So if I wanted to make that really long like a <code>100px</code> long, I can do that and <strong>Save</strong> it and <strong>Refresh</strong>. Actually that didn't make it really long, it made it really short. Let's try something really long at <code>300px</code>. Go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> it and there you go. You can make really long buttons and you can also change the <code>height</code> as well. So, <br>
<em>To change the font color of the "Go do it!" button to blue, the 
presenter types the following code after the closing squiggly bracket of
 the input container:<br>#go<br>{<!-- --><br>color: #0094ff<br>}<br>He 
saves the file and refreshes the web page. The font color of the "Go do 
it!" button has changed from black to blue. Next, to change the 
background color of the button to orange, the presenter types the code 
"background-color: #ff6a00;". He again saves the file and refreshes the 
web page. The background color of the button has changed from grey to 
orange. In a similar way, he changes the background color of the button 
to yellow. Next, to change the width and height of the button, the 
presenter types the code "width: 300px; height: 200px;". He saves the 
file and refreshes the web page to view the change in the width and 
height of the button.</em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
pretty much any CSS style that you can apply to other things like <code>div</code>
 containers, for instance, you can do...you can use rather with form 
elements and make changes to them. Now what that means is you can start 
doing some really interesting things using some of the new transform 
features and background features and linear gradient that are available 
with CSS3. So you're not just limited to sort of creating a single 
static background color and a static text color. You can start to add 
shadows and gradient fields and all sorts of things to get in the sense 
of depth using the CSS3, but that's just sort of a quick introduction to
 how you can style buttons and input elements using HTML5 and CSS. </p>

fields have been around since the beginning of the Web and they are not 
very interesting on their own. Fortunately, you can modify form fields 
using CSS and perform some visually appealing makeovers on the standard 
form. So in this video, I'll explain how to insert an image into a form 
field using CSS3. Okay, so now I've got this <code>form</code> input and it's been styled a little bit. So I've actually added some <code>border</code>
 to it and some depth and a shadow. As a matter of fact, it probably 
made the thing a little too high, let's maybe take that down to a <code>100px</code>, <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong>.
 Yeah, that's not too bad. So now what we're going to do is we want to 
add a background image to this. Now I've already got a background image,
 it's right here. I'll double-click it and you can take a look. So it's a
 little data center image that I'm just going to put in the background 
of this. Now what we want to do is use the <code>form</code> tag and the reason for that is here's the <code>form</code> and all the inputs are inside. So <code>form</code>, think of <code>form</code>
 as a container that contains a bunch of other things. It's like a 
package and in this particular instance, that's what we have got to use 
to put a background in there. We could, I guess, put a <code>div</code> container in there. That's not really a good, no pun intended, form. What we want to do is actually use the <code>form</code> tag and styling in the CSS style sheet. So it looks like this, <code>background-image</code>. And then we're going to use <code>url</code> and then in parentheses the name of the image, in this case, <code>"data.jpg"</code> and a semicolon. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag, a title tag, and a style tag. The following code is enclosed within
 the opening and closing style tags:<br>form<br>{<!-- --><br>font-family: Calibri;<br>font-weight: bold;<br>color: #ffffff;<br>text-shadow: 0px 1px 1px black;<br>width: 250px;<br>height: 180px;<br>padding: 15px;<br>border: 1px solid black;<br>-ms-border-radius: 20px;<br>-webkit-border-radius: 20px;<br>-moz-border-radius: 20px;<br>border-radius: 10px;<br>box-shadow: 0px 0px 25px #000000;<br>}<br>The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;form&gt;<br>&lt;label&gt;User name: &lt;/label&gt;<br>&lt;input type="text" id="uname" /&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;label&gt;Password: &lt;/label&gt;<br>&lt;input type="password" id="pw" /&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="submit" value="Go!" id="go" /&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>The
 web page shows a form containing two text fields – User name and 
Password – and the "Go!" button. In the style tag, the presenter changes
 the value of height from "180px" to "100px". He saves the file and 
refreshes the web page to view the changes in the height of the form. To
 add data.jpg as the background image to the form, the presenter types 
the code "background-image: url("data.jpg");" in the style tag.<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
Now once I <strong>Save</strong> that and <strong>Refresh</strong> the page, you can see that we have quickly added that image to the <code>form</code>
 tag. You might need a little bit of editing. We have to edit down the 
image and that's the important thing to remember...is that you want to 
make sure you have the right image. If it's too big, what you're going 
to see is probably not representative of what you want to look at on the
 image. If the image is too small, it might not fit in the form box. So 
you want to pay attention to that, but it's really easy to do. And 
remember the best method for doing it is to use that <code>form</code> tag and then wrap all your form elements inside and then once you have done that, we can change that using the <code>form</code> tag styling in CSS3. <br>

Changing the Style of an HTML5 Form Using CSS3
</h2>
<div><p>
<strong></strong>
Web page design requires the use of forms whether it's a simple login 
form or a complex membership signup. Forms represent an important part 
of web site creation, but default form fields have been around since the
 beginning of the Web and they are not very interesting on their own. So
 in this video, I'll explain how to change the style of a form using 
CSS3. Now your standard form when you create in HTML is going to look 
something like this. There is not a whole lot to it here, I've got the <code>form</code> tag, I've got some labels, and I've got some inputs, text inputs for name and password, and then a <code>"submit"</code>
 button. Not much to look at, is it? Well, you would be surprised what 
you can do with HTML5 and CSS with forms. Now because there is a lot of 
information here, I don't want to actually spend the time typing it in 
but rather explain sort of what I'm doing here. So the first thing 
is...let's take a look at our form again. We've got our <code>form</code> tag so up here in the <code>style</code> sheet, I've actually created just <code>form</code>, a style for <code>form</code>, and then all this information here from things to font type, <code>font-weight</code>, the <code>color</code>, <code>text-shadow</code>, the <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>, and dimensions, and so on, and a <code>border</code>. And then down here, <code>border-radius</code>. Now <code>border-radius</code>
 is going to allow us to create rounded edges on borders and in order to
 make that work in HTML5 with different browsers, we have to use <code>border-radius</code> and then for IE9 and 10, <code>-ms-border-radius</code>, for Chrome and Safari, <code>-webkit-border-radius</code>, and for Firefox browsers, <code>-moz-border-radius</code>. <br>
<em>The index.html file is open in the Microsoft WebMatrix window and 
the corresponding web page is open in Internet Explorer. The file 
contains two sections, head and body. The head section contains a meta 
tag, a title tag, and a style tag. The following code is enclosed within
 the opening and closing style tags for the form:<br>form<br>{<!-- --><br>font-family: Calibri;<br>font-weight: bold;<br>color: #ffffff;<br>text-shadow: 0px 1px 1px black;<br>width: 200px;<br>height: 180px;<br>padding: 15px;<br>border: 1px solid black;<br>-ms-border-radius: 20px;<br>-webkit-border-radius: 20px;<br>-moz-border-radius: 20px;<br>background: linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background:-webkit-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>box-shadow: 0px 0px 25px #000000;<br>border-radius: 10px;<br>}<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
And down here, same thing. We've created some <code>linear-gradient</code>
 backgrounds and again you're going to have to create one each for the 
different browser types in order to make them work with different 
browsers. And then finally, we've done a <code>box-shadow</code> here and actually I've got two <code>border-radius</code> there and I don't need them but a shadow around that...the box that we've created. So that's how that works. Now here we have <code>input</code> and for <code>input</code> and again let's take a look, we've got 1, 2, 3 different <code>input</code> types, two <code>"text"</code> fields and a <code>"submit"</code> button. And so here I've created a style for <code>input</code> and again given it some dimensions, some <code>padding</code>, some <code>border</code> values that sort of set things up with the way the border is going to look including the <code>border-radius</code>. So we're going to soften the edges of that <code>border-radius</code> using this feature in CSS. And then also apply some <code>linear-gradient</code> here. The <code>linear-gradient</code> are effectively the same <code>linear-gradient</code> that we've used up here. Now finally, I've <code>#go</code> and you know there is a <code>#</code> or hash tag in front of that and that's because here I've created the <code>id="go"</code> for that button. So we just want to change that button itself and we can do that by using the <code>id</code> and a hash tag in the CSS <code>style</code> sheet. And again here, we have applied some different styles to it and <code>border-radius</code>, and <code>background</code>, and <code>box-shadow</code>. <br>
<em>The presenter deletes "border-radius: 10px;" from the code.<br>The following code is enclosed within the opening and closing style tags for the input elements in the form:<br>input<br>{<!-- --><br>width: 180px;<br>background-color: #ff6a0;<br>padding: 6px;<br>margin-bottom: 10px;<br>border-top: 1px solid #ff6a05;<br>border-left: 0px;<br>border-right: 0px;<br>border-bottom: 0px;<br>border-radius: 5px;<br>-ms-border-radius: 5px;<br>-webkit-border-radius: 5px;<br>-moz-border-radius: 5px;<br>background: linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #ff6a00 0%, #ffff00 200%);<br>background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background:-webkit-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>box-shadow: 0px 5px 25px #000000;<br>}<br>The following code is enclosed within the opening and closing style tags for the "Go!" button in the form:<br>#go<br>{<!-- --><br>width: 100px;<br>float: right;<br>font-family: Calibri;<br>font-weight: bold;<br>font-size: 18pt;<br>color: #ffffff;<br>text-shadow: 0px 1px 1px black;<br>border-radius: 10px;<br>-ms-border-radius: 10px;<br>-webkit-border-radius: 10px;<br>-moz-border-radius: 10px;<br>background: linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #ff6a00 0%, #ffff00 200%);<br>background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>background:-webkit-linear-gradient(top, #ffd800 0%, #ff6a00 200%);<br>box-shadow: 0px 5px 25px #000000;<br>}<br>The body section contains the following code:<br>&lt;form&gt;<br>&lt;label&gt;User name: &lt;/label&gt;<br>&lt;input type="text" id="uname" /&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;label&gt;Password: &lt;/label&gt;<br>&lt;input type="password" id="pw" /&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;input type="submit" value="Go!" id="go" /&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br></em>
<br><br>
<strong></strong>
So if I go ahead and <strong>Save</strong> that now and <strong>Refresh</strong>,
 okay, what we've got is a vastly different final product than the one 
that we started out with using just this HTML because we've applied all 
the CSS to it. Now it's not perfect looking, but it certainly is 
functional and it certainly looks a lot better than just that basic form
 and now you can start to type in some information. You will see, it 
acts just the way a form should act and the <strong>Go</strong> button can be clicked and we'll just go ahead and cancel that because nothing really happens when we click <strong>Go</strong>.
 But that shows you how to style forms using HTML5 and CSS and you can 
do a heck of a lot with just a few lines of code to get really, really 
super professional looking effects. <br>

and the "Go!" button. The various effects specified in the style tag are
